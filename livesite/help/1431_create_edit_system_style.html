  <h1>Style Designer</h1>

  <p>The Style Designer is used to create and edit System Page Styles, which are
  pre-built layouts that provide you with areas to drop your content and interactvity
  into. You don't actually add your text and photos here. Instead, you add placeholders
  for "regions" which will be replaced with your content and built-in apps when a Page is
  displayed that uses the Page Style.</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>

          <p>Enter the unique name for this Page Style.</p>

          <p>TIP: Create a naming system for your Page Styles so you can remember how
          many columns each Page Style has and add something descriptive to help you
          remember the important content regions that are unique to this Page Style.</p>

          Style.</p>

        <td>
          <p>You can define the width of any emtpy cells in your Page Style, by setting
          the Empty Cell Width field value. You can use empty cells to create spacing
          between other cells. (You can leave this field blank if you want the width of
          empty cells to be the same as other cells in the same row which is the
          default.)</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Page Layout:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Each Page Style is associated with a single layout when it is created.
          Layouts are designed for common page structures for 1 column pages, or 2 column
          pages with a sidebar, mobile pages, and emailer pages, for example. You cannot
          change a Page Style's layout after it is created, but you can create an
          unlimited number of Page Styles, one for every single Page if you need too!</p>

          <h2>Page Style Areas</h2>

          <p>Within all Page Style layouts, there is are certain areas that have been
          predefined and consistent across all System Page Styles. These areas, like Site
          Border, Site Header, Site Top, etc., are indicated with a solid line
          surrounding their area of influence. These "wrappers" give the Theme Designer
          the "hooks" it needs to attach graphical styling elements to these areas within
          all Page Styles so all Pages on the site can share common graphical elements
          using a single Theme.</p>

          <h2>Adding Content</h2>

          <p>To add content regions to your Page Style, simply add rows and columns to
          any of the predefined content areas within the layout. You do this just as you
          would if you were creating a table with cells in a document.</p>

          <p>You'll notice that you can't change the rows height or the columns width.
          This is not necessary here. Only each region's location and relation to other
          regions around it is important to the Page Style. You see, the height will be
          determined by the amount of content you add, ever-expanding to contain whatever
          is placed within the regions. The width of each column, or area of the layout,
          is dictated by the number of cells in a row, and can be overriden by any Theme
          used to display the Page Style.</p>

          <p>Mobile Page Styles are displayed with a lime-green border for easy
          identification. Mobile Page Styles are limited to one-column layouts since
          sidebars would be unusable when viewed from a mobile phone. The only difference
          between Mobile Page Styles and all other (desktop) Page Styles is the Site
          Border area has been replaced by the Mobile Border area. The Mobile Border is
          used by the Mobile Themes to "float" the Page content to the entire width of
          the device displaying it.</p>

          <p>NOTE: You don't have to assign a content region in each area or cell. Empty
          areas and cells will contain nothing on the Pages that display them, however,
          but the space it occupies will still contain spacing and styling if defined in
          the Theme).</p>

          <h2>Regions</h2>

          <p>There are a number of types of "regions" you can assign to any cell in your
          Page Style layout. Each region replaces the cell with content when a Page is
          displayed that uses the Page Style. The following is a list of the regions
          available:</p>

          <h3>Page Regions</h3>

          <p>Page Regions are replaced with content (text and photos) you add through the
          Rich-text Editor. Even though you are creating and adding them on the Page
          Style, they are actually created for each Page when that Page is assigned to
          the Page Style. Page Regions are referenced in the order they are added to the
          Page Style, from top left to bottom right. So if you remove a Page Region from
          your Page Style, the remaining Page Regions will be renumbered. Since Page
          Regions are created within each Page, removing Page Regions from a Page Style
          does not delete the Page Region or it's content, it only hides it from view.
          (If you delete a Page Region from a Page Style, you can add it back anywhere in
          any Page Style and your content will reappear!)</p>

          <h3>System Regions</h3>

          <p>System Regions are replaced with the interactive features (Login Pages,
          Custom Forms, Calendars, Form Views, Product Catalogs, Photo Galleries, Order
          Forms, etc.) from the Page being displayed itself, or another Page. If a Page
          name is specified in the System Region, then the interactive feature (Page
          Type) for that Page will be inserted into that location. Alternatively, if "Use
          Page" is specified, then the interactive feature for any Page itself will be
          inserted into the location. Each Page Style must include at least one "Use
          Page" System Region (even if its not used).</p>

          <p>Pages with the following Page Types are allowed to be selected for a System
          Region:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Calendar View</li>

            <li>Catalog</li>

            <li>Custom Form</li>

            <li>Express Order</li>

            <li>Folder View</li>

            <li>Form List View</li>

            <li>Form View Directory</li>

            <li>Order Form</li>

            <li>Photo Gallery</li>

            <li>Search Results</li>

            <li>Shopping Cart</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Common Regions</h3>

          <p>Common Regions are replaced with content (text and photos) you add through
          the Rich-text Editor. Common Regions allow you to create content that can be
          shared across one or more Pages throughout your website. Common regions must be
          created first, and then can be added to any Page Style.</p>

          <h3>Designer Regions</h3>

          <p>Designer Regions are replaced with HTML content (javascript, etc). Designer
          Regions allow you to create and place code widgets that can be shared across
          one or more Pages throughout your website. Designer Regions must be created
          first, and then can be added to any Page Style.</p>

          <h3>Dynamic Regions</h3>

          <p>Dynamic Regions are replaced with PHP code that will be executed by the web
          server. Dynamic Regions allow you to create and place PHP code that can be
          shared across one or more Pages throughout your website. Dynamic Regions must
          be created first, and then can be added to any Page Style. For security
          reasons, your Site Administrator must enable Dynamic Regions before they can be
          used.</p>

          <h3>Menu Regions</h3>

          <p>Menu Regions are replaced with the animated dropdown or accordion style
          menus you can add items to from the Edit Page screen. Menu Regions must be
          defined first before you can add them to your Page Styles. (See the IMPORTANT
          note below.)</p>

          <h3>Ad Regions</h3>

          <p>Ad Regions are replaced with the animated sliding or fading ads (text and/or
          photos) you can create from the Ads tab. Ad Regions must be defined first
          before you can add them to your Page Styles. Ad Regions are the only regions
          that must have a predefined width and height for it's animation to work. (See
          the IMPORTANT note below.)</p>

          <p>IMPORTANT: Menu Regions and Ad Regions require an extra step after you add
          or even move them from cell to cell within your Page Style. Once you have added
          or moved a Menu Region or Ad Region within your Page Style and saved it, you
          need to navigate to a Page that uses your new Page Style. Then go into "Theme
          Preview" mode and edit your site's Theme within the Theme Designer and just
          resave the Theme. By resaving the Theme, the Theme Designer will generate the
          proper code to make the animation for your Menu Region or Ad Region work. If it
          is a new region, the animation may not still work, so you will need to reedit
          the Theme and find the fold that contains the new region and update it's
          dimensions until it works to your liking and save the Theme.</p>

          <h3>Chat Region</h3>

          <p>The Chat Region will be replaced by the online/offline chat buttons from the
          Site Settings and the built-in chat code to allow your site visitors to chat
          with your chat operators. This feature is a purchased upgrade. If you do not
          sign up for the a chat plan, the Chat Regions will display nothing and have no
          affect on your Page Styles. See the Who's Online feature for more
          information.</p>

          <h3>PDF Region <sup>beta</sup></h3>

          <p>PDF Regions will be replaced with a PDF icon that will allow Visitors to
          view any Page as a PDF (e.g. to save or print). This is a beta feature that
          might not work for your site. This feature requires the wkhtmltopdf utility
          which your server administrator may install. Your server administrator may read
          the installation guide for more information.</p>

          <h3>Mobile Switch Regions</h3>

          <p>Mobile Switch regions are replaced with either a "Full Site" link or a
          "Mobile Site" link. These links are dynamic toggle the Visitor between Mobile
          Mode and Desktop Mode. So, for example, if the current Visitor or User is
          viewing the site in Mobile Mode and clicks the link, the Page will be redisplay
          in the new mode and vice versa. This allows your Users and Visitors to change
          their mode of display at any time regardless of the device detection features
          of the system. Keep in mind that each mode displays the Page with the
          associated Page Style and Theme defined for that mode.</p>

          you are building out an area of the site that has a different design than the
          rest of the site or if you are working on a new site design. You may leave this
          field unselected if you want this Page Style to use the activated Theme for the
          site.</p>

          <p>If you select a Theme for this field then the rich-text editor will load
          that Theme instead of the activated Theme, when editing a Page.</p>

          Page Style's Theme or the activated Theme for the site.</p>

          <p>Enter one or more CSS classes that will be included in the body tag (e.g.
          home dark large). You should separate multiple classes with a space, and you
          should not include a period before the class name. The layout and Page Style
          name classes will still be included in the body tag if you choose to add
          additional body classes. You can use this feature to add the same class to
          multiple Page Styles, so that you can affect all of them in a certain way.</p>

  <h3>View Source</h3>

  <p>Page Styles are nothing more than the simple HTML page structure that will contain
  your content and interactivity. Click 'View Source' to take a look under the hood and
  the HTML code that is generated. It includes CSS classes for the Theme Designer and
  coders alike to "hook" their own custom CSS into to manipulate and style just about
  everthing displayed! You can also add your own code to the Page Style's HTML
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tag.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you are a CSS coder, you will also see the CSS class names for the Page
  Style and it's areas and regions are listed for reference in case you want to make CSS
  changes within the Theme Designer. See the Theme Designer for more information.</p>
