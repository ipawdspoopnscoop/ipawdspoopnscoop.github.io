  <h1>All Product Groups</h1>

  <p>Product Groups are simply collections of Products. Products are grouped into Product
  Groups for display purposes only.</p>

  <p>Products can be are organized in one or more Product Groups. &nbsp;Product Groups
  are then referenced by Commerce Pages to display Products on your website:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>By associating a Product Group with a Catalog Page, you provide a Visitor with
    access navigate an entire hierarchy of Product Groups and their Products. If you then
    connect a Catalog Page to a Catalog Detail Page, you provide a Visitor with not only
    access to navigate an entire hierarchy of Product Groups and their Products, but also
    the ability to add any of the Products viewed into their Cart and place an Order
    securely.</li>

    <li>By associating a Product Group with an Order Form Page, you provide a Visitor
    with access to see the Product, as well as the ability to Add the Product to their
    Cart, checkout, and purchase the Product through your website.</li>

    <li>By associating a Product Group with a Shopping Cart or Express Order Page (Quick
    Add Product Group feature) you can display additional "up-sell" Products to a
    Customer before they checkout.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you place any Products into Product Groups that are not referenced by a Commerce
  Page, then the Products will not be visible to your Visitors and considered
  unpublished.</p>

  <p>WARNING:&nbsp;Catalog Pages are dynamic in nature, meaning that a single Catalog
  Page (and optional Catalog Detail Page) are capable of displaying your entire hierarchy
  of Product Groups and Products.&nbsp;You need to be sure when you move Products and
  Product Groups around in your Product Group hierarchies, that you are careful not to
  expose wholesale or unpublished Products to your other Customers accidentally.</p>

  will need to be updated or removed as well.</p>
