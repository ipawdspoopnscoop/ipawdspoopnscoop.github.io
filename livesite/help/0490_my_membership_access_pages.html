  <h1>My Membership Access Pages</h1>

  <p>These Pages have been placed in a Membership Folder, which provides you an easy way
  of prompting your site Visitors to register as a member with the website before
  proceeding on the the Page they requested.</p>

  <p>Whenever a site Visitor attempts to access a one of these Membership Pages, and they
  are not logged in, the Membership Entrance Page will be displayed, and they will be
  given the option to register as a member (requires a valid Member ID), or login before
  continuing on to the Membership Page they requested.</p>

  <p>To create a Membership Access Page, simply move any Page into a Membership
  Folder.</p>

  <p>TIP: To get new Members to register, create any Page, (typically you would use it as
  the landing page for your Members), move it to a Membership Folder, and place a link to
  this Page on your public website. Then when a new or unregistered Member clicks on the
  link to access the Member's area of your website,&nbsp;they will be prompted to
  register as a Member. &nbsp;Remember to send your Members their Member ID first (or you
  can have the system assign one if you require them to purchase their membership using
  the Commerce Pages).</p>
