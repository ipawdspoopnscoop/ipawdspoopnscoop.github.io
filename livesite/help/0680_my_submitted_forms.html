  <h1>My Submitted Forms</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the form data collected or imported from any Custom Form
  Pages that you have access to.</p>

  <p>You can collect an unlimited number of Submitted Forms from any Custom Form
  Page.</p>

  <p>Submitted Forms can be searched, filtered, viewed, and exported by any User that has
  Form Management rights to the Folder that contains the Custom Form Page (that produced
  the Submitted Form).</p>

  <h2>Viewing Submitted Forms</h2>

  <p>You can view any Submitted Forms that you have access to.</p>

  <h2>Creating Submitted Forms</h2>

  <p>A Submitted Form is created when a Custom Form Page is submitted successfully.</p>

  <h2>Importing Submitted Forms</h2>

  <p>You can import Submitted Forms using a simple spreadsheet file (CSV text file).</p>

  <h2>Exporting Submitted Forms</h2>

  <p>You can export Submitted Forms into a text file and view them in a spreadsheet
  program.</p>

  <p>You can filter the data that you want to export by using the Search and Advanced
  Filters located at the top of the screen.</p>

  <p>Once you are satisfied with the filtered form data, click the [Export Forms]
  button.</p>

  <p>NOTE: You can only export Submitted Forms for a single Custom Form at a time since
  the column values must match in the export file for it to be useful. Also,
  Information fields and File Upload fields are not exported.</p>

  <h2>Deleting Submitted Forms</h2>

  <p>Select the Submitted Forms you wish to delete and click "Delete Selected".</p>

  <p>NOTE: When you delete Submitted Forms, the associated Custom Form Page is NOT
  deleted.</p>

  <p>WARNING: Take care when deleting Submitted Forms, there is no undo. Once
  you confirm the deletion, the form data (and any uploaded form files) are gone!</p>

  <p>TIP: You might want to export the Submitted Forms to create a backup copy of the
  data before you delete it. However, exporting the data will NOT export any uploaded
  form files (that may have been uploaded through the Custom Form Page).</p>
