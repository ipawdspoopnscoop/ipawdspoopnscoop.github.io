  <h1>All Key Codes</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Key Codes.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Key Codes are simply aliases to an Offer Code, much like a nickname is an alias to a
  person's real name.</p>

  <p>Key Codes are used when many Offer Codes need to be linked to a single Offer Code.
  &nbsp;This is typically used for catalog direct marketing and campaigns when a single
  Offer is advertised to large segmented customer list.</p>

  <p>It is not practical to create hundreds or thousands of Offer Codes, each with the
  same benefit. &nbsp;It is also impossible to track the Offer's popularity within each
  customer segment on your Order Reports if you allowed all Customers to use only a
  single Offer Code.</p>

  <p>TIP: Only the Key Codes should be published to each customer segment. &nbsp;The
  "master" Offer Codes should remain unpublished.</p>

  <h2>Creating Key Codes</h2>

  <p>You can all your Key Codes quickly by importing your Key Codes. &nbsp;Click on
  "Import Key Codes" and following instructions. &nbsp;You can also create Key Codes one
  at a time by clicking "Create Key Code".</p>

  <h2>Deleting Key Codes</h2>

  <p>Once your direct mail campaign and Offer has expired, you can delete all Key Codes
  associated with it. Click on "Delete All Key Codes".</p>

  <p>NOTE: There is no undo, but if you used a Key Code import file to create your Key
  Codes in the first place, you can re-import them again to your Key Codes will be
  restored.</p>
