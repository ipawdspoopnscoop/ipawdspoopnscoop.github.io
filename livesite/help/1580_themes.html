<h1>All Themes</h1>

<p>This screen displays all the Cascaded Style Sheet (CSS) files
that you can use to define the look and feel of your entire website. Themes allow your Site Designers to maintain control of the consistency of the design and content of the website.</p>

<h2>System Themes</h2>

<p>A System Theme is a Theme that was created using the Theme Designer. They are created to work with the System Page Styles generated by the Style Designer.</p>

<p>In order to edit a System Theme, click on the System Theme you want to edit, and then click on the "Edit Theme" button. This will open the Theme you are viewing in the Theme Designer.</p>

<p>To export a System Theme click on the System Theme you want to edit, and then click on the "Export" button. You will then be prompted to download the Theme CSV file.</p>

<p>If you need to backup, or transport a Theme to a different site, then when you export the Theme you will also need to download all of the Design Files that are associated with the Theme.</p>

<h2>Custom Themes</h2>

<p>You can also upload your own CSS files and add them to the head tag area of your HTML and bypass the Theme Designer/Style Designer features completely for ultimate flexibility. We encourage you to start with the System Page Styles and System Themes because they can be manipulated to create almost any site design and layout you can dream up.</p>

<p>To include your own Custom Theme, you can upload it as a Theme / Design File (make sure it has the .css file extension) and add the &lt;stylesheet&gt;&lt;/stylesheet&gt; tag to either a System Page Style (View Source Button), or to a Custom Page Style's &lt;head&gt; tag.</p>

<h2>Searching Themes</h2>

<p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for any Theme by it's properties.</p>

<h2>Creating Themes</h2>

<p>To create a new Theme, click on "Create Theme".</p>

<h2>Activated Themes</h2>

<p>Two Themes can be "active" at any one time on the website. One for desktop (computers and tablets) visitors and one for mobile (phone) visitors. The system will automatically detect and switch Themes based on the device that accesses any web page on the site. We recommend that your Site Designer add a Mobile Switch Region to all Page Styles so any site visitors can choose which Theme they wish to view regardless of the outcome of the automatic detection.</p>

<p>You can override the activated Theme for a specific Page, by editing the appropriate System Page Style and selecting a Theme.</p>
