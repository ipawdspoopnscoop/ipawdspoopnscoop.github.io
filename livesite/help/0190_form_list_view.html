  <h1>Form List View Page Type</h1>

  <p>Form List View Page Type displays one or more rows of submitted data collected from
  a Custom Form. &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field" border="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Custom Form:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Select the existing Custom Form from which you want to display it's
          submitted form data.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Form Item View:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Select the Form Item View that this Form List View will link to. This is
          used by various features (e.g. ^^form_item_view^^, Form View Directory,
          advanced site search, RSS) in order to determine which Form Item View is
          connected to this Form List View. It is important that you select this field
          properly so that links to the Form Item View work correctly.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>TIP: To design your Form View Page's layout of the data fields and add any data
  filters, put the Page into "Edit Mode" or edit the Page Properties, and then edit the
  embedded Form View.</p>
