  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>This is the Welcome screen. This dashboard displays bookmarks to the most recent
  site updates and latest activity across the website.</p>

  <p>You are viewing this screen because you have either just successfully logged into
  the Control Panel, or you have clicked on the logo in the top lefthand corner of the
  Control Panel. All users that can access the Control Panel will be redirected to this
  screen when they first login, unless they are accessing a protected page or file, or
  have a "Start Page" selected in their User account.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Each User will only see information on the Welcome screen that they have
  access too.</p>

  <h2>Control Panel</h2>

  <p>The Control Panel is accessible to Users with management privileges to one or more
  areas in the system. The Control Panel contains quick links to common features shared
  by all Users, located across the top of every screen.</p>

  <p>Here is a quick overview of the Control Panel to help you get around:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>
          <h3>Quick Links</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Logo:</td>

        <td>You can view the Welcome page anytime by clicking on the logo at the top
        lefthand corner of the Control Panel from anywhere within the Control Panel.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Notifications:</td>

        <td>Occasionally, notifications might appear to the right of the logo. These
        notifications will alert you about various things. For example, they will warn
        you if your subscription has expired or if there is an available software
        update.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Site Settings:</td>

        <td>This screen contains all site-wide settings and defaults for your website.
        Only Site Managers and Site Administrators can access and update these
        settings.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Hi, <em>username</em>:</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Logout:</td>

        <td>Clicking this link will log you out of the system and redirect you to your

        <td>My Start Page:</td>

        <td>This link will only be displayed if you have a "Start Page" defined for your
        User account. This feature provides a fast way to jump to your Start Page (kinda
        like a bookmark) from anywhere within the Control Panel.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Home Icon:</td>

        <td>This link will go directly to any one of the Home Pages selected for your

      <tr>
        <td>Help:</td>

        <td>This link will launch the help window for the screen you are currently
        viewing. It will follow your mouse clicks and change on each click as long as you
        have it open.</td>
