  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the most versatile, 100% browser-based professional website builder and
  management solution that makes it simple to build and manage almost any type of
  website. Now you can manage every aspect of all your online organization, from web page
  publishing, collecting web forms and payments, to community blogs, forums and comments,
  to outbound e-mail campaigns. And best of all, much of the system can be mastered
  quickly!</p>

  <p>The key is to separate the website's design (HTML, CSS, etc) from the website's
  content (text, files, photos, videos, etc.), so web designers are free to create HTML
  web designs (or use our built-in themes), and webmasters are free delegate content
  updates and control access to features for others, free from . All without HTML files
  to manage, and no expensive software to load on your desktop.</p>

  <h2>How it Works</h2>

  <p>The main concept behind this data-driven solution is it's simple but powerful
  "page-based" system, which allows webmasters to simply build a website by creating
  Pages, setting their interactive features, placing them into Folders, and linking them
  together.</p>

  <p>Then your Content Managers are free to create and update Page content and link Pages
  together without any HTML programming.</p>

  <p>The system adds powerful and professionally-designed interactive features to any new
  or existing website design. In a typical website, there are many HTML pages, each
  providing only one function - to publish to the Internet. This system offers many
  different interactive "Page Types", each designed to provide integrated building blocks
  to automatically insert interactive features like calendars, photo galleries, blogs,
  forums, directories, order forms, login pages, my account pages, custom forms, data
  views, product catalogs, and shopping carts, to any web page on your site.</p>

  <p>You can combine these interactive pages to create simple or complex website
  applications without the need to know any database programming or website security. You
  can create roles and access control for all features and tasks so you can delegate
  access to management functions, design templates, content areas, and menus, providing
  the building blocks to create interactive client extranets, staff intranets, member
  portals, and other web and e-mail publishing applications - all integrated into one
  database driven solution.</p>

  <h2>Roles</h2>

  <p>The system is a flexible website management system that allows you to assign access
  to all features and delegate tasks to your work force. Here are the roles that have
  been created within the system to manage access to website features and content:</p>
