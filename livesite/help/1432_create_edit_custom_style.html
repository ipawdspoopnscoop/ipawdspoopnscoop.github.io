  <h1>Create / Edit Custom Page Style</h1>

  <p>This screen displays a Page Style and it's properties.</p>

  <p>Page Styles are created and modified by your Web Designer because it requires HTML
  programming experience.</p>

  <p>Page Style can include any valid HTML code, so you can include Flash, DHTML,
  Javascript, images, CSS Style Sheets, and any other typical HTML web page elements.</p>

  <p>Page Styles can be created using any popular web authoring tool such as Dreamweaver,
  GoLive, Coda, Coffee Cup, or any other web authoring tool or text editor that you
  prefer.</p>

  <h2>Code Editor</h2>

  <p>The Code Editor colorizes your code and adds line numbers to make it easier to read
  and debug. The Code Editor may take a while to "read" through your code and colorize
  it. This process is particularly slow on Internet Explorer browsers. We recommend the
  Firefox browser for faster editing throughout the website. It is free to download, and
  works on most desktop computers.</p>

  <h2>Page Style Properties</h2>

          Style.</p>

  <h2>Adding Tags to your HTML</h2>

  <p>One of the most powerful features of the system lies in the fact that you only have
  to add a handful of tags to your HTML page and you have done everything necessary to
  build an entire searchable website, complete with "my account" login privileges,
  membership management, e-commerce, custom forms, protected areas, calendars, photo
  galleries, blogs, forums, ticketing systems, and on, and on.</p>

  <p>Here is a typical HTML page showing only the tags for clarity and not all tags are
  used:<br />
  <br />
  &lt;html&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;meta_tags&gt;&lt;/meta_tags&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;stylesheet&gt;&lt;/stylesheet&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;body&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;menu&gt;<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">main-menu</span>&lt;/menu&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;cregion&gt;<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">site-banner</span>&lt;/cregion&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;pregion&gt;&lt;/pregion&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;system&gt;&lt;/system&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;pregion&gt;&lt;/pregion&gt;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;cregion&gt;<span style=
  "font-style: italic;">site-footer</span>&lt;/cregion&gt;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;<br />
  &lt;/html&gt;<br />
  <br />
  That is all it takes to create an entire, full-featured, database-driven website!</p>

  <h2>The Path Tag</h2>

  <p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag can be inserted anywhere
  in your HTML and is replaced automatically with the absolute URL to the location where
  your system software was installed. You should always use the <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag if you need to reference any uploaded files
  within your HTML. This makes your links portable, so if you ever need to move the
  software system to another directory within your web server, your hand-coded links will
  still work.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Let's look at a typical example.</strong></p>

  <p>Say you want to link to a background image file (example.png) that you uploaded
  through the Design Files within the Control Panel. However, you want to be sure that
  the link is portable because your web server administrator originally installed the
  system software into a temporary directory that looked something like this:
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">http://192.168.0.1/~example/software</span> and
  will need to move the system software to <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">http://www.example.com/software</span> once you have setup
  your domain and are ready to launch the site.</p>

  <p>So if you hard-code your link to example.png file like this:<br />
  <br />
  <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">http://192.168.0.1/~example/software/files/example.png</span>
  or<br />
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">/files/example.png</span><br />
  <br />
  Then when the system software is moved later to another directory, this link would no
  longer work. So instead, be sure to link to the file using the <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag:<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}files/example.png</span></p>

  <p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag is only necessary within
  your custom HTML such as Custom Page Styles, Editable Head Content in System Page
  Styles, Designer Regions, and within custom CSS files. The <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag is not necessary when adding links through
  the Rich-text Editor. These links will be converted automatically for you when the
  content region is saved.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you are the web server administrator and move the system to another
  directory off of your webroot after installation, be sure to update your .htaccess file
  per the system's installation / update instructions.</p>

  <h2>The System Tags</h2>

  <p>When you create a new Page Style, you'll notice that we already prefill your HTML
  Code with a valid HTML page to get you started. &nbsp;Here is a listing of all the
  system tags that you can embed within your Page Styles.</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <h3>&lt;head&gt;</h3>
        </td>

        <td><br />
        These tags must be placed between the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags in your Page
        Style.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>&lt;meta_tags&gt;&lt;/meta_tags&gt;</td>

        <td>This&nbsp;tag will be replaced with the &lt;meta&gt; tags and the contents of
        the Page's Description and Keyword fields (or, if blank,&nbsp;the defaults in the
        Site Settings).&nbsp;These are typically referred to as a "meta tags" and Search
        Engines use this information to help classify Pages.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE:&nbsp;There should be no spaces or characters between the set of tags.&nbsp;
        You can only define this tag ONCE in each Page Style.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>&lt;stylesheet&gt;&lt;/stylesheet&gt;</td>

        <td>
          <p>This&nbsp;tag will be replaced with a &lt;stylesheet&gt; statement and link
          to a style sheet file (CSS). This tag is is ideal for Site Designers of
          seasonal shopping sites to&nbsp;easily change the entire website look and feel
          using a single CSS style sheet.</p>NOTE:&nbsp;There should be no spaces or
          characters between the set of tags. You can only define this tag ONCE in each
          Page Style.<br />
          <br />
          IMPORTANT: You must include this tag if you are using Themes, they rely on this
          tag to be present in the Page Style to function.

        (or, if blank,&nbsp;the default Title in the Site Settings). It will display in
        the Visitor's browser window (title bar area). This is&nbsp;typically referred to
        as a "meta tag" and Search Engines use this information to help classify
        Pages.<br />

        IMPORTANT: Unlike all other regions, you do not create Page Regions manually.
        They are created automatically when a Page is created, and the number of Page
        Regions created is determined by the number of Page Region tags found in the

  <h2>Previewing a Page Style</h2>

  <p>To preview a Page Style simply click on the "Preview" button. This will open up the
  Page Style Preview window and display a Page that is using the HTML code that is in the
  editor.</p>

  <p>NOTE: The "Preview" button does not save the changes you have made to the Page
  Style. However, all changes will be retained in the editor until the "Cancel" button is
  clicked.</p>

  <p>While previewing a Page Style you can use the "Page to Preview" pick list to change
  the Page you are previewing to any Page within your site. This is helpful when building
  micro-sites.</p>

  <p>NOTE: While previewing a Page Style, if you click on a link that is on the Page that
  you are previewing then it will take you out of the preview mode.</p>

  <h2>Fixing a Broken Login Page</h2>

  <p><br />
  Since even the system itself uses a Page Style to define the Login Page for Site
  Administrators and Designers,&nbsp;if you accidentally remove the
  &lt;system&gt;&lt;/system&gt; tag from the Login Page's Page Style, you will not be
  able to login to your website!<br />
  <br />
  If this happens, you can use the login URL shortcut to login:<br />
  <br />
  <a href=
  "http://example.com/%5E%5ESOFTWARE_NAME%5E%5E/index.php?u=username&amp;p=password">http://<span style="font-style: italic;">www.mywebsite.com</span>/login/index.php?u=<span style="font-style: italic;">username</span>&amp;p=<span style="font-style: italic;">password</span></a><br />

  WE RECOMMEND YOU MAINTAIN A BOOKMARK USING YOUR OWN WEBSITE, USERNAME, AND
  PASSWORD.</p>

  <p>Be sure the first thing you do once you have logging is add the
  &lt;system&gt;&lt;/system&gt; tag back into the Login Page's Page Style, so you and
  your other Users can use the Login Page again!</p>
