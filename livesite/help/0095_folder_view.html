  <h1>Folder View Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Folder View Page will list Folders, Pages (which are included in site search),
  and Files that are inside of the same Folder as the Folder View Page and that the
  Visitor has access to. This Page Type is useful when you want to give your Visitors or
  Users a dynamic list of the content that they have access to. For example, you might
  want to use this Page Type for an intranet that shows private Pages that a User has
  access to.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field" border="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Include Pages:</td>

        <td>Check this in order to include Pages in the list of items. You can either
        include only Pages, only Files, or both. Please be aware that this feature will
        only include Pages where "Include in Site Search" is checked. This allows you to
        choose which Pages you want to include in the Folder View.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Include Files:</td>

        <td>Check this in order to include Files in the list of items. You can either
        include only Pages, only Files, or both.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>The Folder View will include a link to the User's start Page at the top, if one
  exist and if the start Page is not the same as the Folder View Page.</p>

  <p>The Folder View does not just show the items directly under the Page's folder; it
  also digs deep into child Folders in order to show all items. The Folder View will only
  show items that the Visitor has access to. The Visitor must be logged in in order to
  see Private or Membership items. Registration and Guest items will be shown, even if
  the Visitor is not logged in. Once the Visitor clicks on a Registration or Guest item,
  then he/she will be asked to login or register.</p>

  <p>The Folder View does not show the following items:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Items that User does not have access to.</li>

    <li>Folders that have no items to list.</li>

    <li>Pages that are not included in the site search.</li>

    <li>Archived items.</li>

    <li>The Folder View Page itself.</li>

    <li>The following Page types are not included:

      <ul>
        <li>Registration Confirmation</li>

        <li>Membership Confirmation</li>

        <li>View Order</li>

        <li>Custom Form Confirmation</li>

        <li>Form Item View</li>

        <li>Calendar Event View</li>

        <li>Catalog Detail</li>

        <li>Shipping Address &amp; Arrival</li>

        <li>Shipping Method</li>

        <li>Billing Information</li>

        <li>Order Preview</li>

        <li>Order Receipt</li>

        <li>Affiliate Sign Up Confirmation</li>

        <li>Affiliate Welcome</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If Files are selected to be included, then Design Files will also be included.</p>

  <p>Folders are listed in order by their sort order property. Pages and Files are listed
  in alphabetical order, with Pages being listed above Files.</p>

  <p>If a Page has a web browser title, then that will be used for the link label.
  Otherwise, the Page name is used. If a web browser description exists then the
  description will be included below the link. For Files, the File name is always used
  for the link label. If a File has a description, then the description will be included
  below the link.</p>

  <p>The name of a Folder, that a Visitor does not have view access to, might still be
  shown if the Folder contains a child Folder that the Visitor does have view access to.
  The Folder View works this way in order to preserve hierarchy and indentation. Pages
  and Files directly under the Folder are not shown (only the Folder name appears), so
  this does not cause a security issue.</p>
