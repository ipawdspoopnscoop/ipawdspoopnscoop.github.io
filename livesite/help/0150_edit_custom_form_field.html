  <h1>Create/Edit Custom Form Field</h1>

  <p>There are several different field types that can be added to any Custom Form.&nbsp;
  Each field type has properties to allow you to collect many different types of
  information.<br />
  <br />
  Here is a list of the Field Types you can collect using a Custom Form and their
  associated properties:</p>

  <table class="field" style="width: 100%;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Type:</p>
        </td>

        <td><span style="font-weight: bold;">Text Box<br />
        <br /></span> This field type is used to collect a single line of text data.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Name:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>This is the Name of this field.&nbsp; It is displayed for sorting purposes
          and is the column heading when the collected form data for this field is
          exported.</p>

          <p>The field name cannot contain the following special characters: ^ &amp; [ ]
          &lt; &gt; /</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>RSS / Search Element:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>This will link a Custom Form field to an RSS Element and/or a Site Search
          Element.</p>

          <p>RSS Elements are used with Form List View Page Types to broadcast Submitted
          Forms as an RSS feed and are defined as follows:</p>category: This is the RSS
          category that the Submitted Form will be in.<br />
          title: This is the RSS title for the Submitted Form.<br />
          description: This is the RSS description for the Submitted Form.<br />

          <p>NOTE: You must have at least one field in your Custom Form linked to an RSS
          Element before a feed can be created.</p>

          <p>NOTE: You will need to make sure that the Form Item View page property for
          the Form List View Page is set or that the layout for the Form List View
          contains a link to a Form Item View Page so that the links in the RSS will
          work.</p>

          <p>Site Search Elements are used to store form data for the results set that is
          displayed when a site search is performed and are defined as follows:</p>title:
          Select this value for any field you wish to be used by Site Search as the Title
          of the submitted form data in the search results.<br />
          description: Select this value for any field you wish to be used by Site Search
          as the Description of the submitted form data in the search results.

          <p>This is the Label that is displayed to the left of the field in the Custom
          Form, the optional Custom Form Confirmation, and when the collected form data
          is viewed.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Required:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>If data must be present in this field for the Custom Form to be submitted,
          check this box.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Default Value:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>If this field should be prefilled with a default value when the form
          appears, enter the value here. For example, if you have a "city" field on your
          form and you know that the majority of your Visitors will need to submit
          "Dallas", then you can enter that for a default value so that Visitors do not
          have to enter it.</p>

          <p>Alternatively, you may check to use the Folder name as the default value.
          The field will then be prefilled with the Folder name for the Page that the
          form appeared on. If the form was embedded via a secondary System Region, then
          the Folder for the Page that was requested in the address bar will be used. See
          example below for how this feature can be used.</p>

          <p>Let's say that you are the administrator for a school's website. You want to
          allow staff members to submit news articles via a form for both the Athletics
          department and the Fine Arts department. John should only have access to submit
          articles for Athletics. Mike should only have access to submit articles for
          Fine Arts. You can create one Custom Form with a department pick list field
          that is office use only with options for "Athletics" and "Fine Arts". You can
          check to use the Folder name for the default value. Then, you can setup two
          different Folders called "Athletics" and "Fine Arts" (make sure the Folder
          names match the department field options exactly). Then, create two different
          pages that have the same embedded Custom Form via a secondary System Region in
          a Page Style. Then, give John view access to the Athletics Folder and give Mike
          view access to the Fine Arts folder. Make sure that that Mike and John do not
          have edit or view access to the Folder that the original Custom Form is in.
          Now, when John or Mike submits the form on their own pages, they will not see
          the office use only department field and the correct department value will be
          submitted along with the form. You can then create two different Form List
          Views for the two departments using view filters so that website Visitors can
          view the articles for each department.</p>

          <p>If this field is connected to a Contact field and the Visitor is logged in,
          then the Contact field value will be prefilled and the default value will be
          ignored. Also, the default value will be ignored even if the Contact field
          value is blank, so that if a User submits a form multiple times and wants a
          field to be empty, he/she won't have to remove the default value every
          time.</p>

          <p>If a field does not appear on the form because it is an office use only
          field, the default value will still be submitted with the form, behind the
          scenes.</p>

          <p>If the field is also required, the default value will meet that
          requirement.</p>

          <p>If you would like this field to be pre-filled with a field from the
          Submitter's Contact record, select the field your would like to connect.&nbsp;
          When the Custom Form is submitted, the Contact field will be updated with the
          value submitted for this field.</p>

          <p>NOTE:&nbsp; This feature will only work if the Submitter is logged into the
          system when the form data is submitted (ie. the Page containing the Custom Form
          is located in a non-public Folder).&nbsp; Also, take care not to connect to a
          Contact field that cannot store the same type of data or you may experience
          unexpected results (see Contacts for more information).</p>

          <p>TIP: If someone needs to submit a Custom Form on behalf of someone else and
          the submitter does not want his/her Contact info prefilled or updated, then the
          submitter can add "?connect_to_contact=false" to the end of the URL in order to
          disable the Connect to Contact feature. An example appears below.</p>

          <p>Check this box to hide this field from the Submitter.&nbsp; Once the Custom
          Form is submitted, Users that have access to the form's data will be able to
          view and modify this field.</p>

          calculation.&nbsp; (This field works in conjunction&nbsp;with the "Enable Quiz"
          and "Quiz Pass Percentage" properties of the Custom Form, which&nbsp;prevents
          the submitter from going to the&nbsp;"Next Page" without a passing

          "Dallas", then you can enter that for a default value so that Visitors do not
          have to enter it.</p>

          <p>Alternatively, you may check to use the Folder name as the default value.
          The field will then be prefilled with the Folder name for the Page that the
          form appeared on. If the form was embedded via a secondary System Region, then
          the Folder for the Page that was requested in the address bar will be used. See
          example below for how this feature can be used.</p>

          <p>Let's say that you are the administrator for a school's website. You want to
          allow staff members to submit news articles via a form for both the Athletics
          department and the Fine Arts department. John should only have access to submit
          articles for Athletics. Mike should only have access to submit articles for
          Fine Arts. You can create one Custom Form with a department pick list field
          that is office use only with options for "Athletics" and "Fine Arts". You can
          check to use the Folder name for the default value. Then, you can setup two
          different Folders called "Athletics" and "Fine Arts" (make sure the Folder
          names match the department field options exactly). Then, create two different
          pages that have the same embedded Custom Form via a secondary System Region in
          a Page Style. Then, give John view access to the Athletics Folder and give Mike
          view access to the Fine Arts folder. Make sure that that Mike and John do not
          have edit or view access to the Folder that the original Custom Form is in.
          Now, when John or Mike submits the form on their own pages, they will not see
          the office use only department field and the correct department value will be
          submitted along with the form. You can then create two different Form List
          Views for the two departments using view filters so that website Visitors can
          view the articles for each department.</p>

          <p>If this field is connected to a Contact field and the Visitor is logged in,
          then the Contact field value will be prefilled and the default value will be
          ignored. Also, the default value will be ignored even if the Contact field
          value is blank, so that if a User submits a form multiple times and wants a
          field to be empty, he/she won't have to remove the default value every
          time.</p>

          <p>If a field does not appear on the form because it is an office use only
          field, the default value will still be submitted with the form, behind the
          scenes.</p>

          <p>If the field is also required, the default value will meet that
          requirement.</p>

        <td>
          <p>If this field should be prefilled with a default value when the form
          appears, enter the value here. For example, if you have a "city" field on your
          form and you know that the majority of your Visitors will need to submit
          "Dallas", then you can enter that for a default value so that Visitors do not
          have to enter it.</p>

          <p>Alternatively, you may check to use the Folder name as the default value.
          The field will then be prefilled with the Folder name for the Page that the
          form appeared on. If the form was embedded via a secondary System Region, then
          the Folder for the Page that was requested in the address bar will be used. See
          example below for how this feature can be used.</p>

          <p>Let's say that you are the administrator for a school's website. You want to
          allow staff members to submit news articles via a form for both the Athletics
          department and the Fine Arts department. John should only have access to submit
          articles for Athletics. Mike should only have access to submit articles for
          Fine Arts. You can create one Custom Form with a department pick list field
          that is office use only with options for "Athletics" and "Fine Arts". You can
          check to use the Folder name for the default value. Then, you can setup two
          different Folders called "Athletics" and "Fine Arts" (make sure the Folder
          names match the department field options exactly). Then, create two different
          pages that have the same embedded Custom Form via a secondary System Region in
          a Page Style. Then, give John view access to the Athletics Folder and give Mike
          view access to the Fine Arts folder. Make sure that that Mike and John do not
          have edit or view access to the Folder that the original Custom Form is in.
          Now, when John or Mike submits the form on their own pages, they will not see
          the office use only department field and the correct department value will be
          submitted along with the form. You can then create two different Form List
          Views for the two departments using view filters so that website Visitors can
          view the articles for each department.</p>

          <p>If this field is connected to a Contact field and the Visitor is logged in,
          then the Contact field value will be prefilled and the default value will be
          ignored. Also, the default value will be ignored even if the Contact field
          value is blank, so that if a User submits a form multiple times and wants a
          field to be empty, he/she won't have to remove the default value every
          time.</p>

          <p>If a field does not appear on the form because it is an office use only
          field, the default value will still be submitted with the form, behind the
          scenes.</p>

          <p>If the field is also required, the default value will meet that
          requirement.</p>

          When the Custom Form is submitted, the Contact field will be updated with the
          value submitted for this field.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>NOTE:&nbsp; This feature will only work if the Submitter is logged into the
          system when the form data is submitted (ie. the Page containing the Custom Form
          is located in a non-public Folder). Also, take care not to connect to a Contact
          field that cannot store the same type of data (see Contacts for more
          information).</p>

          <p>TIP: If someone needs to submit a Custom Form on behalf of someone else and
          the submitter does not want his/her Contact info prefilled or updated, then the
          submitter can add "?connect_to_contact=false" to the end of the URL in order to
          disable the Connect to Contact feature. An example appears below.</p>

          <p>If this field should be prefilled with a default value when the form
          appears, enter the value here. For example, if you have a "city" field on your
          form and you know that the majority of your Visitors will need to submit
          "Dallas", then you can enter that for a default value so that Visitors do not
          have to enter it.</p>

          <p>Alternatively, you may check to use the Folder name as the default value.
          The field will then be prefilled with the Folder name for the Page that the
          form appeared on. If the form was embedded via a secondary System Region, then
          the Folder for the Page that was requested in the address bar will be used. See
          example below for how this feature can be used.</p>

          <p>Let's say that you are the administrator for a school's website. You want to
          allow staff members to submit news articles via a form for both the Athletics
          department and the Fine Arts department. John should only have access to submit
          articles for Athletics. Mike should only have access to submit articles for
          Fine Arts. You can create one Custom Form with a department pick list field
          that is office use only with options for "Athletics" and "Fine Arts". You can
          check to use the Folder name for the default value. Then, you can setup two
          different Folders called "Athletics" and "Fine Arts" (make sure the Folder
          names match the department field options exactly). Then, create two different
          pages that have the same embedded Custom Form via a secondary System Region in
          a Page Style. Then, give John view access to the Athletics Folder and give Mike
          view access to the Fine Arts folder. Make sure that that Mike and John do not
          have edit or view access to the Folder that the original Custom Form is in.
          Now, when John or Mike submits the form on their own pages, they will not see
          the office use only department field and the correct department value will be
          submitted along with the form. You can then create two different Form List
          Views for the two departments using view filters so that website Visitors can
          view the articles for each department.</p>

          <p>If this field is connected to a Contact field and the Visitor is logged in,
          then the Contact field value will be prefilled and the default value will be
          ignored. Also, the default value will be ignored even if the Contact field
          value is blank, so that if a User submits a form multiple times and wants a
          field to be empty, he/she won't have to remove the default value every
          time.</p>

          <p>If a field does not appear on the form because it is an office use only
          field, the default value will still be submitted with the form, behind the
          scenes.</p>

          <p>If the field is also required, the default value will meet that
          requirement.</p>
