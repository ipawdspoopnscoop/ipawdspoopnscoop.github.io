  <h1>My Registration Access Files</h1>

  <p>These Files have been placed in a Registration Folder, which provides you an easy
  way of prompting your site Visitors to register with the website before proceeding on
  the the File they requested.</p>

  <p>Whenever a site Visitor attempts to access a one of these Files, and they are not
  logged in, the Registration Entrance Page will be displayed, and they will be required
  to either register or login, before continuing on to the File they requested.</p>

  <p>To create a Registration Access File, simply move any File into a Registration
  Folder.</p>
