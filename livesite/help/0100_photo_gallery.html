  <h1>Photo Gallery Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Photo Gallery Page will create proportional thumbnail images to your
  specifications for all "Albums" and "Photos" that are inside of the same Folder as the
  Photo Gallery Page.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field" border="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Number of Columns:</td>

        <td>Set this to the number of columns that you wish to display on the Photo
        Gallery. This is the number of thumbnails that will go across the screen.
        Thumbnail images are created automatically based on the image they are associated
        with.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Thumbnail Max Size:</td>

        <td>This is the maximum dimension that the thumbnails will be. The thumbnails
        will be scaled proportionally based on the value entered into this field. For
        example if you have a "Photo" that is 300 px by 200 px, and if you set the
        "Thumbnail Max Size" to 100, then the width of the thumbnail will be set to 100
        and the height will be calculated automatically.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>TIP: If you are using a digital camera, consider resizing the original image files
  rather than relying on the Thumbnail Max Size property to adjust the size of your
  images to fit the Page. This will also help your Photo Gallery Page to load faster.</p>

  <h2>Setting up Photo Galleries</h2>

  <p>Photo Gallery Pages display all "Albums" and "Photos" found in the same Folder as
  the Page itself.</p>

  <p>If a Folder is inside of the Photo Gallery Page's Folder, and if it contains at
  least one "Photo", then the Folder is considered an "Album" and it will be displayed on
  the Photo Gallery Page. The viewer can then click on the "Album" to view all of the
  "Albums" and "Photos" inside of it.</p>

  <p>A Photo Gallery Page will display all of the web-safe image files (.jpg, .gif, .tif,
  .png) that are found in the same Folder. Each image file is displayed in alphabetical
  order.</p>

  <p>TIP: You can create unlimited Photo Galleries and control both the view access and
  edit access to them very easily by using Folders to secure your Pages and Files.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To setup a Photo Gallery:</span></p>

  <p>1) Create a Folder for your Photo Gallery. You can also create sub-Folders within
  the Photo Gallery Page's Folder to be displayed as "Albums".<br />
  <br />
  2) Create a Photo Gallery Page and place it in the Folder.<br />
  <br />
  3) Zip your photos into a zip file and upload it into the same Folder as the Photo
  Gallery Page. If you are wanting to create "Albums" then you will need to repeat this
  step for each "Album" within the Photo Gallery Page's Folder.<br />
  <br />
  4) View your Photo Gallery and adjust as necessary by editing it's Page Properties.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Securing your Photo Gallery</span>:</p>

  <p>1) Make sure that the Folder containing the Photo Gallery is either Membership or
  Private, depending on your intended audience. This will make the gallery only visible
  to these Users. If you select Private, you will also need to grant "view" rights to any
  Users that you wish to show the Photo Gallery too.<br />
  <br />
  2) If you want to allow someone else to edit the Photo Gallery, grant them "edit"
  rights to the Folder.</p>
