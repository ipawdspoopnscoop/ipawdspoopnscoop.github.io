  <h1>Custom Form Confirmation Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Custom Form Confirmation Page Type allows you to display a confirmation page
  after a Custom Form has been &nbsp;submitted.&nbsp;This page will display the data
  submitted, a reference code for the form data, and a timestamp of the receipt of the
  form data. &nbsp;This Page can also be e-mailed to the Submitter, as well as e-mailed
  to anyone on your staff.</p>

  <p>A Custom Form Confirmation Page can be used to show a confirmation for any Custom
  Form. This means that you may use one Custom Form Confirmation Page for multiple Custom
  Form Pages, if you want.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field" border="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Continue Button Label:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Enter the text you wish to display for the "Continue" button.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Next Page:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>The Page that you want the Submitter directed to when the "Continue" Button
          is clicked.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>NOTE: This Page will only display the information if the submitted form has been
  found during the current session (before they leave the website or close their
  browser).</p>
