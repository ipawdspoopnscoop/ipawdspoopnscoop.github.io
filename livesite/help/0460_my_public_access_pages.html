  <h1>My Public Access Pages</h1>

  <p>These Pages have been placed in a Public Folder, accessible by any site Visitor or
  User.<br />
  <br />
  TIP: If you are developing your website and don't want your website "viewable" to the
  public until you officially launch, you can change the top-level Folder from Public to
  Private. &nbsp;This will make all website Pages protected from access by any Visitor or
  User that does not have "view" rights to the top-level Folder. Remember, if you do
  this, you will not be able to test any registration processes since they are never
  displayed to Users who are already logged into the website.<br />
  <br />
  To create a Public Access Page, simply move any Page into a Public Folder.</p>
