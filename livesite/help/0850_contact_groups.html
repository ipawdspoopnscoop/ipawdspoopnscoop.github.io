  <h1>All Contact Groups</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Contact Groups that you have access too. Contact
  Managers can import, update, and delete all Contacts in any their Contact Groups they
  manage.<br />
  <br />
  All Contacts are organized into Contact Groups. Contact Groups can be used to simply
  group Contacts together for purposes of organization or classification, but more
  commonly are to create mailing lists for sending e-mail Campaigns.</p>

  <p>If a Contact Manager is also a Campaign Manager, they can also create e-mail
  Campaigns and send to all Contacts within their Contact Groups.</p>

  <p>TIP: Since Contact management rights for Contact Groups can be given to individual
  Users, Contact Groups are ideal for managing e-mail lists (and subscriptions) by
  department, ministry, organization, team, or topic.</p>

  <h2>Creating &amp; Updating Contact Groups</h2>

  <p><br />

  <h2>Deleting Contact Groups</h2>

  <p>You must be a least a Site Manager to delete Contact Groups. To delete a Contact
