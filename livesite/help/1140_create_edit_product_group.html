        Catalog page or should be grouped together in a pick list for selection on a
        Catalog Detail page. For example, this might be a Product Group that contains
        other Product Groups and/or Products that are not highly related, so you would
        want the items to be displayed on a Catalog Page, so a Customer could browse to
        them separately. Alternatively, this might be a Product Group that only contains
        highly related products (e.g. Small Shirt, Medium Shirt, Large Shirt), so you
        would want the products to be displayed together in a pick list on a Catalog
        Detail page.</td>

        the bottom of Catalog or Catalog Detail pages (below the table of items on
        Catalog Pages or below details on Catalog Detail Pages). This field is useful for
        code that can't easily be added to the full description or details because those
        fields use a rich-text editor.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: You can use this field in order to paste conversion/tracking code from
        analytics or advertising services.</td>

        will be used to promote this Product Group in both the Site Search and Catalog
        Page Search results.<br />
        <br />
        Search Keywords are displayed as hyperlinks on the Catalog and Catalog Detail
        pages whenever this Product Group is displayed. When clicked by a Visitor, these
        hyperlinks will search within the scope of the Catalog page (defined by it's
        Parent Product Group) and will display any other Product Groups and Products that
        contain data that matches the Search Keyword.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This field is only displayed when the Display Type is set to "Display
        contents for selection on catalog detail page".<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: The keywords in this field will be added to the Tag Cloud if this Product
        Group is included in any Product Groups that are being searched by a Search
        Results page.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: Even if there is no Site Search or Catalog Search enabled on your site,
        Visitors will still be able to click on any Search Keyword hyperlinks. This may
        be useful if you want to control what keyword searches they can perform.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: You might not need to enter Search Keywords for this Product Group if Search
        Keywords have already been entered for all of the Products in this Product Group
        (since the Products will be searched too).</td>

        <td>This is a thumbnail image that is used for catalog pages.<br />

        For example: If this Product Group is a group of office chairs for sale, then you
        would want an image of a group of chairs.</td>

        <td>Catalog Name:</td>

        <td>This is the name that the system will use to create the URL link to this
        Product Group. The Catalog Name will appear in the address bar of the browser
        when a Visitor is viewing this Product Group. If you leave the Catalog Name
        blank, then the Short Description or Product Group Name (if Short Description is
        blank) will be used.<br />
        <br />
        A Catalog Name may not be used by another Product Group or Product. If the
        Catalog Name that you entered is already in use then the system will
        automatically add a unique number to the end of the Catalog Name.<br />
        <br />
        Example: A Catalog Name of "electronics" would result in a Search Engine Friendly
        URL to one of the Product Group's Products named "boombox" to be
        "/electronics/boombox".<br />
        <br />
        TIP: Search engines use the content that appears in addresses for ranking search
        results, so it is important to set a good Catalog Name.</td>

        <br />
        TIP: To make an item that is out of stock or unavailable, but still viewable on
        Dynamic Catalog pages, do not select any Products to Include, and then set the
        Display Type to "Display contents for selection on catalog detail page". This
        will prevent the customer from purchasing the product, but allows them to view
        its details.</td>
