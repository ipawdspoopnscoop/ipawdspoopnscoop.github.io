  <h1>My RSS Enabled Pages</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Pages that you have access to that also have RSS
  enabled.</p>

  <p>RSS is a web content syndication format, and its name is an acronym for Really
  Simple Syndication. The pages listed here will broadcast an RSS feed. RSS allows site
  visitors to be informed when content changes on your website. A Page has to be a either
  a Form List View, Calendar View, Catalog, Catalog Detail, or Order Form Page Type, and
  it has to be in a Public Folder. RSS is enabled for these Pages automatically.</p>

  <h2>Channel Title and Description</h2>

  <p>The content for the Channel Title and Description elements is determined in
  different ways, depending on the Page Type (see below). Fields are listed in the order
  that they are looked at for a value. If a field does not have a value, then the next
  field in the list is looked at.</p>

  <p>For Form List View, Calendar View, and Order Form Page Types:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Channel Title: Page's Web Browser Title.</li>

    <li>Channel Description: Page's Web Browser Description.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For Catalog and Catalog Detail Page Types:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Channel Title: Product Group's Web Browser Title, Product Group's Short
    Description, Page's Web Browser Title.</li>

    <li>Channel Description: Product Group's Web Browser Description, Product Group's
    Full Description (converted to plain text), Page's Web Browser Description.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Form List View Pages</h2>

  <p>Up to 50 of the most recent Submitted Forms are available, based on the RSS Element
  fields defined in the Custom Form. NOTE: In order for RSS to be enabled for a Form List
  View Page, there has to be at least one RSS Element defined in the Custom Form fields
  associated with the Form List View Page.</p>

  <p>The RSS feature will use the Form Item View page property from the Form List View in
  order to determine which page to link each RSS item to. If the Form List View field is
  left unselected, then the RSS feature will attempt to find the correct Page by looking
  for a link in the layout of the Form List View.</p>

  <h2>Calendar View Pages</h2>

  <p>The soonest 50 upcoming Events across all Calendars displayed on the Page are
  included in the RSS feed. RSS item elements found in the Calendar View Page feeds
  are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Item Category: Calendar's Name.</li>

    <li>Item Title: Calendar Event's Name.</li>

    <li>Item Description: Calendar Event's Short Description.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Catalog, Catalog Detail, and Order Form Pages</h2>

  <p>All Products that exist in the current Product Group will appear as items in the
  feed. For Catalog pages, Products from all levels of the Catalog will appear in the
  feed, starting from the Product Group that is currently being viewed. Please be aware
  that an RSS link will not appear on a Catalog Detail Page that is showing a Product,
  instead of a Product Group.</p>

  <p>RSS item elements found in these feeds are listed below. The fields are listed in
  the order that they are looked at for a value. If a field does not have a value, then
  the next field in the list is looked at.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Item Title: Product's Web Browser Title, Product's Short Description.</li>

    <li>Item Description: Product's Web Browser Description, Product's Full Description
    (converted to plain text and only used if it is not the same as the Short
    Description), Parent Product Group's Web Browser Description, Parent Product Group's
    Full Description (converted to plain text).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>TIP: You can use an RSS feed for Catalog, Catalog Detail, and Order Form Pages to
  create a Data Feed for importing into other systems such as Google Merchant Center,
  allowing prospects to better find your Products through search engines and other public
  websites.</p>
