  <h1>All My Pages</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Pages that you have access to, except archived Pages
  (see All My Archived Pages). It is the combination of all other Page listings.</p>

  <p>The system is a "page-based" system, meaning most of building your website is done
  by creating Pages, setting design styling, interactive properties, adding content, and
  then linking them to other Pages.</p>

  <h2>Viewing &amp; Editing Pages</h2>

  <p>You can view and edit any Page you have access to by selecting the Page from any of
  the Pages screens, which are grouped by Page Type. &nbsp;Some of the Page's properties
  are also visible.</p>

  <h2>Searching Pages</h2>

  <p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for any Page by
  it's properties. &nbsp;(Page content is excluded from the search).</p>

  <h2>Modifying Pages</h2>

  <p>You can modify the Folder, Page Style, search, and sitemap.xml options for one or
  more Pages by selecting the Pages you wish to modify and clicking "Modify Selected".
  Since access control is handled by the Page's Folder, modifying the Page allows you to
  easily protect a Page.<br />
  <br />
  WARNING: Since changing a Page's Folder effects it's access control, you can
  accidentally make a Private Page accessible or a Public Page inaccessible to others
  attempting to view the Page. Keep this in mind when moving Pages among Folders.<br />
  <br />
  WARNING: Moving a Page can also change the Page's Page Style, which could accidentally
  hide Page Region content and include new common content. &nbsp;If this
  happens,&nbsp;you can always change the Page Style back to the original Page Style and
  the Page Regions will reappear. &nbsp; Page Regions are never lost unless you delete
  the content or delete the Page itself.</p>

  <h2>E-mailing Pages</h2>

  <p>You can easily e-mail any Page in it's native HTML-format (and text format) to a
  single recipient or a group of recipients, we call "Subscribers".</p>

  <p>There are two ways to e-mail a Page:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Campaigns.</span>&nbsp;Pages can be e-mailed to
    any number of Subscribers using the built-in Campaign feature. This allows you to
    send e-newsletters, e-announcements, and promotional messages to your customers.
    members, and prospects. You must have access to these features in order to use
    them.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auto-responders.</span> Pages can be sent by the
    system in response to an action taken by a Visitor,&nbsp;like when an Order is
    placed,&nbsp;a Custom Form is submitted, or a specific Product is ordered.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Creating Pages</h2>

  <p>To create a Page, click on "Create Page" or view an existing Page and click
  "Duplicate Page".</p>

  <h2>Commenting on Pages</h2>

  <p>To comment on a Page, be sure that Comments are enabled in the Page's Properties.
  This will display the Comment form on the Page. If CAPTCHA is enabled in the Site
  Settings, then comments are protected from SPAM. Spammers use unprotected web forms in
  an attempt to use another's website to post and broadcast their own advertising. To
  combat this malicious technique, all Comment forms have a built-in CAPTCHA feature that
  is automatically enabled if it Comment form is displayed to any site visitor that has
  is not logged into the website. The CAPTCHA asks a simple challenge question that the
  visitor must answer correctly in order to submit the Comment.</p>

  <h2>Deleting Pages</h2>

  <p>To delete a Page, select the Page you wish to delete and click "Delete Selected".
  Only the Page (and it's Properties such as Custom Form or Form List/Item View Layout),
  Page Regions, Comments, and Comment Attachments are deleted. Menu and Ad Regions, Ads,
  and all other common regions and their content as well as it's Page Style remain.</p>

  <h2>Indexing Pages</h2>

  <p>If you have Advanced Site Search Type enabled in Site Settings, then the system
  spider can perform a deep search through your website Pages and Files and the resulting
  data (called an index) will be stored securely in the system's database. If Advanced
  Site Search is enabled, and you are a Site Manager, Site Designer, or Site
  Administrator, you will see the "Update Search Index" button and you can manually
  update the index at any time. You only need to update the search index if you think new
  content has been added to your website pages.&nbsp; (Products are searched in real-time
  and not stored in the index so there is no need to update the index for Product
  changes.) It may take several minutes to run the update for larger sites.</p>

  <p>TIP: If you purchase a software subscription, your Server Administrator can set up a
  Scheduled Task (called a cron job) to update the search index periodically, so that you don't
  have to manually update the Site Search Index.</p>

  <h2>Desktop / Mobile Page Styles</h2>

  <p>Clicking on "show mobile" or "show desktop" will toggle the display of the Page's
  Page Style that will be used by the mobile detection feature to display the Page to
  your site visitors. If the Page Style is colored red, it means that the system could
  not find a Mobile Page Style for the Page, and it will default to use the Desktop Page
  Style to display the Page to mobile (phone) visitors. You should consider adding a
  Mobile Page Style for any Page that does not have one defined for it.</p>

  <p>NOTE: The Delete Selected button only appears for Users that have access to delete
  Pages.</p>

  <p>WARNING: Take care when deleting Pages, there is no UNDO.</p>
