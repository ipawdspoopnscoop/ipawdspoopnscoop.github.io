        <br />
        TIP: Be sure this is a Page in a Folder with the appropriate access for all
        Visitors that view the Menu.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 2em;">Enable Security:</td>

        <td>
          <p>Check this if you only want this Menu Item to appear if the Visitor has
          access to view the Page you have selected above. For example, if you want to
          add a staff link to the main Menu for your site, but you only want the link to
          appear for staff members, then check this feature.</p>

          <p>Even though you may generally want to hide Menu Items from Visitors who do
          not have access to them, there are some situations where you might want the
          Visitor to see the Menu Item. For example, you might have a members link that
          allows Visitors to access the members area or register as a Member. A members
          link might also allow you to show off your membership features to all Visitors
          in order to encourage them to become Members. Please be aware that even if you
          leave security disabled for the Menu Item, the access control on the Page still
          remains intact. In other words, once the Visitor clicks to the Page, the normal
          access control checks will be done at that time (e.g. Visitor must
          login/register to become a Member).</p>

          <p>You should only enable this feature if you are sure you need it, because it
          requires extra processing during each page view. For example, don't enable this
          feature for Pages with public, registration, or guest access control. For those
          types of access control, the Menu Item will be displayed regardless of this
          setting, because the Visitor has the ability to gain access to them.</p>

          <p>If you enable this feature and the Menu Item does not appear, then its child
          Menu Items will also not appear. This means that you do not have to check this
          feature for all child Menu Items.</p>

          <p>This feature only works if you have selected a Page from the pick list. It
          will not work if you enter a URL, even if the URL is a local URL to this
          website (e.g. /pages/example). Also, this feature does not currently work for
          links to Files.</p>

        website, view the File and place the link to the File here, like:
