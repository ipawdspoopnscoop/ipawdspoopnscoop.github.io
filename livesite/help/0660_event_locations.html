  <h1>All Event Locations</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Event Locations.</p>

  <p>Event Locations&nbsp;are shared among all Calendar Events to offer&nbsp;you a
  uniform way to specify common event locations and prevents scheduling conflicts.</p>

  <p>Event Locations are ideal if you&nbsp;have meeting rooms, conference rooms,
  auditoriums, or other venues where events commonly occur and you need to manage
  scheduling conflicts.</p>

  <p>You can add as many Event Locations as you need and use each of them when your
  Calendar Managers create Events.</p>

  <p>TIP: Since Event Locations are shared across all Calendar Events that reference
  them, you can change the Locations name and all Events will be updated with the new
  name automatically.</p>

  <h2>Managing Scheduling Conflicts</h2>

  <p>Whenever an Event is created and assigned to an Event Location, the sytem
  automatically checks for any scheduling conflicts for the same Event Location across
  all Calendars. &nbsp;If a conflict is found, the system requests that the new Event be
  rescheduled and prevents it from being created.</p>
