  <h1>Create Page Style</h1>

  <p>The screen allow you to create new Page Styles to be used to define new content
  layouts for your website (it's HTML framework essentially). "System" Page Styles can be
  easily manipulated with the built-in Style Designer without coding so they are
  recommended. If you are an HTML coder, you can also create your own "Custom" Page
  Styles from scratch so there are no limits to the layout of the site you can create.
  You can even mix these two Page Styles if you have complex website requirements or
  integration needs with third-party web services.</p>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>
          <h3>What type of Page Style do you want to create?</h3>
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td>System</td>

        <td>System Page Styles are based on popular web page layouts and are created for
        you. That is to say, the system will generate and store the HTML for all System
        Page Styles.<br />
        <br />
        System Page Styles were designed so you don't have to know any HTML coding, and
        enjoy error-free HTML pages, We highly recommend that you use System Page Styles
        for your website pages.<br />
        <br />
        To create a System Page Style, simply pick the layout of the System Page style
        you wish to start with and Continue. The Style Designer will be launched and you
        can begin adding your content regions within the layout you selected. System Page
        Styles can then be edited at any time.<br />
        <br />
        IMPORTANT: If you want to define a Page Style that will be used to display it's
        associated Page automatically whenever a mobile (phone) visitor is detected, you
        MUST select the "1 column, Mobile" Page Style Layout. All other Page Style
        Layouts will only be visible to Desktop (computers and tablets) site
        visitors.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Custom</td>

        <td>Custom Page Styles allow you complete freedom to add your own HTML, creating
        your own unique content layouts. You can import any existing website design or a
        website template into Custom Page Styles. You will be required to add system tags
        to identify where you wish content and interactive features to be placed.<br />
        <br />
        To create a Custom Page Style, simply select Custom and Continue. The HTML editor
        will be launched and you can begin adding your HTML and adding your content tags.
        Custom Page Styles can be edited at any time.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: If you are an HTML coder, you can create Custom Page Styles that will also
        work with the Theme Designer. You will need to examine the HTML page source of a
        System Page Style within your browser to understand the tags you will need to
        include to make your own HTML Page Styles compatible.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>TIP: We recommend that you create System Page Styles instead of Custom Page Styles.
  System Page styles allow you to move content regions around using the Style Designer
  without the need to worry about HTML coding. System Page Styles are fully compatible
  with themes created by the Theme Designer.</p>

  <p>TIP: You would use more Page Styles if you are creating not only a public site, but
  a staff intranet site, a members-only portal site, or an extranet for your clients,
  each with their own menus and common content - and all within the same website!</p>

  <p>Take care when modifying or deleting Page Styles, Theme files, and Designer Files.
  Making a mistake could cause your website to be unusable. There is no undo!</p>
