<p>This screen allows you to update the Status of a particular Commission manually.&nbsp; You can move any Commission to any Status at any time:</p>
<table class="field">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Status:</td>
<td><strong>Pending:</strong> When an order is successfully placed, if they shopper entered the Affiliate's Code in the Offer Code area, or they used the Affilate's tracking code link to reach your site in the last 90 days, and commissions are due, then the system will create a new "Pending" commission. If any Products are recurring, then a Commission Profile will also be created and enabled for each recurring Product by the system. (See Commissions Profiles for more information).<br /><br /><strong>Ineligible:</strong> For order gets cancelled, rejected, or otherwise do not meet the terms of your affiliate agreement, you can change the commission's status to "Ineligible", which ends the process of the commission. (Make sure you also disable any associated Commission Profile too if a recurring Product was ordered).<br /><br /><strong>Payable:</strong> Once the order or payment grace period you determine for success has transpired, and the commission is not Ineligible, you would change the commission's status to "Payable". At this point the Affiliate has earned the commission.<br /><br /><strong>Paid:</strong> Once your payment terms to Affiliates has been reached, and payment to the Affiliate has been made, you would change the status of the commission to "Paid", which would complete the commission's process.</td>
