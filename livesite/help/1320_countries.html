  <h1>All Countries</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Countries.</p>

  <p>Countries provide two geographical functions for the website.</p>

  <p>First, they are used to define Shipping Zones, Product Shipping Zones,&nbsp;and Tax
  Zones.</p>

  <p>Secondly, they are used to create the address entry fields that your Customer will
  use to enter their billing address and each recipient's shipping addresses.</p>

  <p>The Billing Address is entered by the Customer</p>

  <ul>
    <li>during checkout on the Billing Information Page, or the Express Order Page, or
    the Order Preview Page.</li>

    <li>after they login and view their My Account information, and update their billing
    address on the Account Profile Page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Shipping Address is entered by the Customer</p>

  <ul>
    <li>during checkout on the Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Page.</li>

    <li>after they login and view their My Account information, and update their shipping
    addresses on the Update Address Book Page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>TIP: If you don't accept orders or ship orders to more than one Country, you should
  delete all other Countries. Once you have done this, the website will no longer prompt
  the Customer for a Country selection. Instead, the sole&nbsp; Country in the system
  will be used by default, displayed for completeness, but will not be editable by the
  Customer.<br />
  <br />
  IMPORTANT: If a Country does not have any States defined for it, the website will
  display a blank text area for the Customer to enter the State value themselves. This
  value will be saved and exported with the Order data.</p>
