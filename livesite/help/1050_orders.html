<h1>All Orders</h1>
<p>This screen displays all the Orders successfully submitted. &nbsp;Orders can be searched, filtered, viewed, and exported by any User that has Commerce Management rights.</p>
<h2>Viewing Orders</h2>
<p>You can view any Orders. You can filter the data that you want to export by using the Search and Advanced Filters located at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>If shipping is enabled in the Site Settings and an Order contains a shipping tracking number, then a truck icon will appear that links to the website for the shipping carrier. This allows you to quickly view which Orders have been shipped. If there are multiple tracking numbers for an Order, then multiple truck icons will appear. If the system cannot determine the shipping carrier for a tracking number, then a truck icon will still appear, however it will not be linked.</p>
<p>NOTE: When "Advanced Filters" are not displayed (removed), only Complete Orders are displayed. &nbsp;To view Incomplete Orders (Saved Carts), you will need to Add Advanced Filters and set the Order Status.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are viewing sensitive customer/payment information on this screen, then it is recommended that your site have an SSL certificate and that secure mode be enabled. Please contact your hosting provider for more information about an SSL certificate, and please see the Site Settings for more information about secure mode.</p>
<h2>Creating Orders</h2>
<p>A Order is created when an Order Preview Page or Express Order Page is successfully submitted.</p>
<p>Orders are the collection of information about an sales or donation transaction.</p>
<p>Order are linked to the Contact associated with the Customer. &nbsp;If a Customer orders while logged in, the Order will also be linked to the User.</p>
<p>All Orders contain an Order number, Reference Code, date and time, billing information, payment information, Products ordered and their quantity and price, Order amount, and other referral data if collected.</p>
<p>If a Offer is applied to the Order, then the Order Code and Discount amount is also stored.</p>
<p>If Shipping is enabled, any Shipping amount per recipient is also collected.</p>
<p>If taxation is enabled and the Products ordered are taxable, and the Customer is not tax-exempt, then the Tax amount is also collected.</p>
<p>If a payment gateway is enabled, then the Transaction ID and Authorization Code from the processor is also retrieved and stored.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saved Carts</span></p>
<p>All&nbsp;Orders begin as a "Cart" when a Visitor first selects Products from any Order Form Page or Express Order Page and clicks the submit button (Add to Cart). &nbsp;A Cart is basically an incomplete Order, and data fields will begin to accumulate and be stored with the Cart as the Visitor moves through the Commerce Pages.</p>
<p>A Cart can be viewed at any time when a Shopping Cart Page or Express Order Page is displayed. Items in the Cart remain there until either the Visitor closes their browser, or places an Order using the Payment Preview Page or Express Order Page.</p>
<p>Once the Customer places the Order, the Cart is converted into a Complete Order and it is no longer visible from the Shopping Cart Page.</p>
<p>Carts are created in the website database and are maintained within the Customer's browser "session". In this way, they are alway "Saved Carts", so you can link to them by their unique Reference Code and retrieve them later, or send them as links in an e-mail. To find out a Save Cart's Reference Code, simply display the Shopping Cart Page and at the bottom of the page will be a link to the Saved Cart. You can also view all the Carts by looking at the "Incomplete Orders" View.</p>
<p>When a Cart is displayed on an Order Preview Page or an Express Order Page, and the [Purchase] button is clicked, all required fields are completed with appropriate information and do the following:</p>
<p>If a payment gateway is not selected (see Site Settings), the Saved Cart will be converted to an Order and all Order information will be stored in the website database.</p>
<p>If a payment gateway is selected, then the credit/debit card information is sent securely to the payment gateway. If an error occurs during processing, an error message will be displayed, and the Order will NOT be submitted. If&nbsp; no errors occur and the mode is "Live", the Cart will be converted to an Order and saved in the website database. If the mode is "Test" or "Sandbox", the credit card will be processed through the payment gateway, but the charges will NOT be posted to the credit/debit card.</p>
<p>TIP: Use Test or Sandbox mode to verify that the payment gateway is processing valid cards properly. Once that has been confirmed, change the mode to "Live" to process actual transactions.</p>
<p>When a Cart is successfully converted to an Order, the Order Number is calculated (by incrementing 1 to the Next Order Number in Settings) and stored, along with the date and time of the Order, and the Order Receipt Page is displayed. Also, an optional order receipt is e-mailed to the Customer, using the e-mail address from the billing information.</p>
<p>Now the Order can be viewed, exported, and deleted using the Order view and Order Report views. Orders cannot be edited.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating e-Quotes</span><br /> <br /> You can also use the Saved Cart feature to send quotes to anyone via e-mail.</p>
<p>To do this,&nbsp;create a Cart and view it in a Shopping Cart Page. &nbsp;At the bottom of the Shopping Cart Page is a link to the Saved Cart. Paste or bookmark this link and include it in an e-mail to your prospect.&nbsp;When the prospect clicks the link, they will be directed to the Shopping Cart Page, which will be populated with the Saved Cart. &nbsp;They can update the Cart as needed, checkout, and place the Order.</p>
<p>TIP: It does not matter who creates the Saved Cart, because no User information is stored in the Saved Cart. &nbsp;The Saved Cart can be recalled at any time from the Cart's creator through the My Account Page, or by anyone using the Saved Cart link. In this way, the Saved Cart can be viewed and update by several people before it is finally converted into an Order. Once the Cart becomes an Order, the person placing the Order becomes the new owner and is the only person that can view the Order through the My Account Page.</p>
<p>NOTE: Since all Product information is pulled from the database in real-time when a Saved Cart is viewed,&nbsp;the current Product information and pricing is recalculated and displayed.</p>
<h2>Exporting Orders</h2>
<p>You can export Orders into a text file and view them in a spreadsheet program for importing into your back-end fulfillment system. Based on the needs of your staff or other third-party systems, you have two options for exporting your Order data.&nbsp; You can export your Order data in multiple files or a single file.</p>
<p>You can filter the data that you want to export by using the Search and Advanced Filters located at the top of the screen. Once you are satisfied with the filtered form data, click either [Export Orders] button.</p>
<h3>Understanding Order Export Files</h3>
<p>There are three data records that make up an Order:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bill To Information</span> (Order Summary): contains the billing information for the customer.&nbsp; There is only one of these records per Order.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ship To Information</span>: contains the recipient(s) information.&nbsp; For multi-recipient shipping, there many be one or more of these records per Order.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Line Item Information</span>: contains the Product(s) information.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is may be one or more of these records per Ship To record.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a visual illustration of an Order:<br /> <br /> <span style="font-style: italic;">Order Summary / Bill To Information #1</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship To Information #1</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #1</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #2</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #3</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship To Information #2</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #4</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #5</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #6</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">Order Summary / Bill To Information #2</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship To Information #3</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #7</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ship To Information #4</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line Item Information #8</span><br /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Single File Order Export</span></p>
<p>Single file export files can be opened by any spreadsheet program and are easy to read by humans.&nbsp; Use this method of exporting when you don't need to import the Order data into another database system.</p>
<p>To create a single export file, filter the Orders view to display the Orders you wish to export.</p>
<p>Click [Export Orders (single file)] button to create a file that contains a single CSV file contains all the records for the Orders as follows:<br /> <br /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Order Number", "Order Field1", Order Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"", "Ship To Name", "Ship To Field 1", "Ship To Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"", "", "Product Name", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"", "Ship To Name", "Ship To Field 1", "Ship To Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"", "", "Product Name", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"", "", "Product Name", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <br /> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple File Order Export</span></p>
<p>Multiple file export files are more difficult to read for humans, but are necessary for most import processes of third-party database applications such as accounting or fulfillment systems.&nbsp; Multiple file export files are made up of three or four files: Order/Bill To Information, Ship To Information, Line Item Information, and Shipping Tracking Number Information (if shipping tracking numbers exist). Each file uses a unique ID (key) that joins it to it's associated records in the other files.</p>
<p>To create a multiple file export, filter the Orders screen to display the Orders you wish to export.</p>
<p>Click [Export Orders (multiple files)] button to create a compressed ZIP file containing the three or four CSV files with all the records for the Orders as follows:</p>
<p>orders.csv file contains:<br /> <br /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Order ID", "Order Number", "Order Field1", Order Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Order ID", "Order Number", "Order Field1", Order Field 2", ...</span><br /> <br /> ship_tos.csv file contains: <br /> <br /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ship To ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To Field 1", "Ship To Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ship To ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To Field 1", "Ship To Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ship To ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To Field 1", "Ship To Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ship To ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To Field 1", "Ship To Field 2", ...</span><br /> &nbsp;<br /> order_items.csv file contains: <br /> <br /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Line Item ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Line Item Field 1", "Line Item Field 2", ...</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <br /> shipping_tracking_numbers.csv file contains: <br /> <br /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Shipping Tracking Number ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Number"</span><br style="font-style: italic;" /> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Shipping Tracking Number ID", "Order ID", "Order Number", "Ship To ID", "Number"</span></p>
<h2>Removing Card Data</h2>
<p>Select the Orders you wish to remove card data for and click "Remove Card Data for Selected". When card data is removed, the credit card number is starred out (except for the last 4 digits) and the verification number is removed permanently. The card type (e.g. Visa), cardholder, and expiration date are preserved.</p>
<p>You can find Orders that still contain card data by looking for a check mark in the card data column of this screen.</p>
<p>In order to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) it is recommended that you remove card data after the credit/debit card has been authorized.</p>
<h2>Deleting Orders</h2>
<p>Select the Orders you wish to delete and click "Delete Selected".</p>
<p>WARNING:&nbsp;Take care when deleting Orders, there is no undo. &nbsp;Once you confirm the deletion, the Order data is gone!</p>
<p>TIP: You might want to export the Orders to create a backup copy of the data before you delete it.</p>
