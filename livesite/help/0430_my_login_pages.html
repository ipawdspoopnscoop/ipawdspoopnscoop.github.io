  <h1>My Login Pages</h1>

  <p>These Page Types are used to manage the registration, login, change random password,
  and logout processes for &nbsp;the website.</p>

  <h2>Registration Entrance Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Register/Login
  page that will be display automatically to any Visitor attempting to access a Page or
  File that has been restricted (placed in a Folder that is either a Guest Access or
  Registration Access Folder).</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Registration Process:</span> When a Visitor
  attempts to access a Page or File that has been restricted, the Registration Entrance
  Page is displayed. &nbsp;If the Visitor has not registered on the website before, they
  will be asked to do so now. When the Visitor registers successfully, a User Account and
  a corresponding Contact is created for them. If the optional Registration Contact Group
  is specified in Site Settings, their newly created Contact is also placed in that
  Contact Group. Then the newly registered User is logged in and directed to the
  Registration Confirmation Page, where the registration process continues.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Login Process:</span> When a returning User (who
  has previously registered) attempts to access a Page or File that has been
  restricted,&nbsp;the Registration Entrance Page is displayed. The Visitor enters their
  Username and Password, is logged in, and directed to the restricted Page of File.
  &nbsp;The login process is complete.</p>

  <p>TIP: You do not need to link to this Page directly. &nbsp;However, if you want to
  send your returning Registered Users directly to their own Start Page upon login,
  simply create a link directly to the Registration Entrance Page, and they will be
  directed to the Start Page defined in their User account.</p>

  <h2>Registration Confirmation Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Registration
  Confirmation Page that will be displayed automatically after a successful User
  registration. This Page will also be emailed to the Registration E-mail Address in the
  Site Settings so that someone on your staff can be alerted about the registration.</p>

  <p>The Registration Confirmation Page displays a "Continue" button. When pressed by the
  now Registered User, the User is directed to the restricted Page or File. The
  registration process is now complete.</p>

  <h2>Membership Entrance Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Membership
  Register/Login page that will be display automatically to any Visitor attempting to

  attempts to access a Page or File that has been protected, the Membership Entrance Page
  is displayed. &nbsp;If the Visitor has not registered on the website before, they will
  be asked to do so now. In order to register, the Visitor will need know their Member
  ID, provided to them off-line, prior to this moment. &nbsp;When the Visitor registers
  successfully,&nbsp;a User Account is created and connected to their existing Contact.

  newly created Contact is also placed in that Contact Group. Then the newly registered
  Member User is logged in and directed to the Membership Confirmation Page, where the
  membership registration process continues.</p>

  Member User (who has previously registered as a member) attempts to access a Page or
  File that has been protected,&nbsp;the Membership Entrance Page is displayed. The
  Member enters their Username and Password, is logged in, and directed to the protected
  Page of File. &nbsp;The login process is complete.</p>

  <p>TIP: You do not need to link to this Page directly. &nbsp;However, if you want to
  send your returning Members directly to their own Start Page upon login, simply create
  a link directly to the Membership Entrance Page, and they will be directed to the Start
  Page defined in their User account.</p>

  <h2>Membership Confirmation Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Membership
  Confirmation Page that will be displayed automatically after a successful Member
  registration. This Page will also be emailed to the Membership E-mail Address in the
  Site Settings so that someone on your staff can be alerted about the new Member.</p>

  now Registered Member, the Member User is directed to the protected Page or File. The
  membership registration process is now complete.</p>

  <h2>Login Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Login Page that
  will be displayed automatically when a Visitor attempts to access a private Page or
  File (located in a Private Folder),&nbsp;or access the Control Panel.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Private Page or File</span>: When a User attempts
  to access a private Page or File, the Login Page will be displayed and the User will be
  prompted to login.&nbsp;If they login successfully, they will be directed to theprivate
  Page or File they where attempting to access. &nbsp;This also occurs any My Account
  Pages are accessed.</p>

  attempts to login to the Control Panel,&nbsp;the Login Page will be displayed and the
  User will be prompted to login.&nbsp;If they login successfully, they will be directed
  to the Welcome Page. However, if a Start Page is defined for the User, they will be
  directed to that Page instead.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accessing their Start Page</span>: If you create a
  link directly to the Login Page, when a User clicks this link,&nbsp;the Login Page will
  be displayed and the User will be prompted to login.&nbsp;If they login successfully,
  they will be directed to the Start Page defined for their User Account.<br />
  <br />
  TIP: Use the Start Page feature for your staff Users so when they login, they can
  always go the their Start Page, which can be the home page of your private staff
  portal.<br />
  <br />
  TIP: If you don't want to provide Login capabilities from any Page, your Site Designer
  can add a Login Region to any of your Page Styles.</p>

  <h2>Logout Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Logout Page.
  &nbsp;When this Page is viewed, the current User will be logged out instantly. &nbsp;A
  link to the Login Page is also displayed.</p>

  <h2>Forgot Password Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Forgot Password
  Page. &nbsp;This Page presents the&nbsp; Visitor with a form to enter their User
  account e-mail address. &nbsp;If the e-mail address matches a User account, then the
  User account's Password Hint is displayed (if not blank). &nbsp;If the User is unable
  to remember their password from the Password Hint (if enabled), then the User account
  password is reset and a temporary password is e-mailed to the User account holder.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Using the Password Hint feature makes User accounts less secure so you should
  use caution if you enable this feature.&nbsp;You can disable this feature for all Users
  in the Site Settings. &nbsp;You can also disable the forgot Password link from all
  Login Pages in the Site Settings.</p>

  <h2>Change Random Password Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Change Random
  Password Page. &nbsp;This Page Type is displayed immediately after a successful login
  has occurred using a temporary password. &nbsp;This Page prompts the User to enter a
  new password of their choosing. This practice keeps passwords secure since only the
  User knows what it is, passwords are never transmitted via e-mail, and passwords are
  encrypted when stored.</p>

  <p>NOTE: The first Page of each of these Page Types that is found within your website
  will be displayed (be sure to place them all in a Public Folder). &nbsp;If any of these
  Pages are found missing from your website, a default page will be displayed for each
  Page Type so that your website will continue to function correctly, but no Page Style
  will be used (no branding). &nbsp;To create any of these Page Types,&nbsp;click on
  "Create Page". &nbsp;You should only have one Page with of each of these Page Types on
  your website.</p>
