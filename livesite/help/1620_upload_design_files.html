  Clicking "Upload" to send the Design File from your local computer up to the web
  server. Please be patient, large Design Files may take a few minutes.</p>

  <p>NOTE: There is no maximum file size that can be uploaded, however, success will
  depend on your own Internet connection speed at the time of the upload, and any file
  size limitation that your hosting provider sets on your hosting account. If you receive
  an error, we recommend trying the upload at a less busy time of day or trying the
  upload with a smaller file.</p>
