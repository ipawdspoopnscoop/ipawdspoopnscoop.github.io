  <h1>All Currencies</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Currencies.</p>

  <p>Currencies allow Customers to convert base Currency amounts into the Currency of
  their choice while viewing and navigating the Commerce Pages.&nbsp;This is ideal if you
  have foreign Customers that want to see your Product prices and Order Totals displayed
  in their own Currency.</p>

  <p>When Customers select a different Currency it is for display purposes only. This
  means that all calculations are still done in the base Currency, all payments are still
  collected in the base Currency, and all Orders are still stored and exported in the
  base Currency, regardless of the Currency selected by the Customer.</p>

  <p>You can select one base Currency. The base Currency will be the Currency that you
  use for entering amounts in the control panel and it is the default Currency that will
  be displayed to each Customer. Also, it is the Currency that will be passed to your
  payment service/gateway.</p>

  <p>TIP: Any Currency that is selected by a Customer and used throughout their checkout
  process will be stored and exported with the Order data.&nbsp;This means you can also
  create Order Reports and track your Customers by the Currencies they prefer.</p>

  <h2>Adding Currencies</h2>

  <p>Click on "Add Currency" to add another Currency for your Customers to select while
  browsing your Commerce Pages.<br />
