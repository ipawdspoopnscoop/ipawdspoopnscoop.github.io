<h1>All Common Regions</h1>

<p>Common Regions are shared content areas that you can create for your
Site Managers to maintain directly from a Page using the Rich-text
Editor.</p>

<p>Common Regions typically contain word processor type information like text, tables, photo, and event videos.</p>

<p>Common Regions are considered "safe", meaning your Site Managers and Content Managers can edit them, but cannot delete them from your Page Styles inadvertently.</p>

<p>Since Common Regions are placed into Page Styles, they become shared
content that can be displayed on one, some, or all of your website
Pages.</p>

<p>TIP: Common Regions are ideal for website headers and footers.
They are also good for creating different departmental website area
content shared only among Pages in a certain area.</p>

<p>Unlike Page Regions, Common Regions must be created manually by the Site Designer before they can be edited.</p>

<p>Once you have created the Common Region, add a &lt;cregion&gt; tag to one, some, or
all of your Pages Styles to specify the location and scope of your Common Region
across your website's Pages.</p>
