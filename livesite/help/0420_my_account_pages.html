  <h1>My Account Pages</h1>

  <p>These Page Types allow you to define My Account features for each User. This
  information is dynamically presented to the User that is logged in when the Page is
  viewed.&nbsp; This information is used to pre-fill other Page Types such as the
  Commerce Page Types and the Custom Form Page Types.&nbsp; All information that a User
  can manage themselves is accessible from this Page.</p>

  <p>The system will display the first Page of each of these Page Types that it finds, so
  you should only have one Page in your the system with this Page Type! If any of these
  Page Types are missing from your website, a default page will be displayed for the Page
  Type so that your website will continue to function.</p>

  <p>These Page Types provided so that you can create your own custom to display the
  User's stored information, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Username</li>

    <li>Start Page</li>

    <li>Reward Points</li>

    <li>Membership Information</li>

    <li>Contact information</li>

    <li>Billing information</li>

    <li>Address Book information</li>

    <li>Incomplete Orders (Saved Carts)</li>

    <li>Completed Orders (Order History)</li>

    <li>Affiliate Information &amp; Commissions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The My Account page is a smart page, and displays only the information that applies
  to the User or the Site Settings in general. For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the User has Reward Points (greater than zero), then they will be
    displayed.</li>

    <li>If the User has a Start Page defined, then a link to that page will be
    displayed.</li>

    <li>If the User is a an approved Affiliate, this page will display their Affiliate
    Code, Commission Rate, and Commission amounts.</li>

    <li>If the User is a Member, then this page will display their Member ID and
    Expiration Date.</li>

    <li>If the User has used any of the e-commerce features, then any Saved Carts and
    Order History for the User are displayed.</li>

    <li>If the Site's Settings Page has "multi-recipient" shipping enabled, then the
    User's Address Book of recipients will be available. If not, then the Address Book
    functionality will be hidden since it is irrelevant.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Account Page</h2>

  <p>This Page displays the User's Personal Contact Information and links to the other
  account pages: My Account Profile, Email Preferences, View Orders, and Change Password.
  If any commerce features have been used, any Saved Carts, Order History, and Shipping
  Address Book is displayed.</p>

  <p>NOTE: You only need to link to the My Account Page. All other account page types are
  automatically linked to this Page.</p>

  <h2>My Account Profile Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Page to allow
  Users to update their Contact/Billing information.</p>

  <h2>Change Password Page</h2>

  <p>A Change Password Page presents a form that allows a logged in User to change their
  password.</p>

  <h2>E-Mail Preferences Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Page to allow
  Users to update their e-mail address and e-mail subscriptions. This Page displays a
  selection check box to the User to indicate whether they wish to receive ANY e-mail
  from subscriptions available to them.</p>

  <p>A User can deselect this global opt-in/opt-out setting for their User Account to
  refuse any e-mail regardless of whether they have previously signed up for e-mail in
  the past. If the User selects the checkbox, then they are eligible to receive e-mails
  from any group that they are a member of. They can opt-in and opt-out of any
  subscription at any time.</p>

  <p>A subscription is like a mailing list.&nbsp; Subscriptions can be "open" or
  "closed".&nbsp; Open subscriptions allow Users to opt-in and opt-out at any time
  through this Page Type.&nbsp; Closed subscriptions are used to create mailing lists
  where the Users must be added to the subscription by a Site Editor (an employee mailing
  list would be a good example of a closed subscription).&nbsp; For more information,
  please refer to Contact Groups.</p>

  <h2>Update Address Book Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is provided a way for your Customers to add and update their shipping
  addresses.&nbsp; These addresses are collected whenever they complete an Order and are
  used to pre-fill shipping addresses for future orders.</p>

  <h2>View Order Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type provides a way for your Customers to view their submitted Orders.
  Customers can also find shipping tracking codes (if available) to track shipments and
  view split shipments (see View Order under Commerce to add these values for any order)
  from this page as well as reorder the same products and services from the previous
  Order.</p>

  <p>To create any of these Page Types, click on "Create Page". You should only have one
  Page with these Page Types on your website.</p>
