  WARNING: If you create a User with the same e-mail address as an existing Contact, no
  connection between the two will be made by the system. If you do this by mistake, you
  can delete the Contact and ask the User to register again, so that a new Contact can be
  created by the System and connected to the User. You can reference the "My Contacts by
  User" and "My Registered User" screens to display all connected Contacts and User
  accounts.</p>
