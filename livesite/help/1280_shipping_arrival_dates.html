  <h1>All Shipping Arrival Dates</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Arrival Dates used for shipping Products.</p>

  <p>Arrival Dates allow you to offer your Customer the ability to select their Requested
  Arrival Date for each recipient in their Cart.&nbsp;This is very important if you are
  offering gifts for purchase and your customers need the Products to arrive on or before
  a special occasion (the recipient's birthday or anniversary, event, or a holiday).</p>

  <p>The Arrival Dates you create and enable are displayed to the Customer on the
  Shipping and Arrival Page during the checkout process. If you do not want the customer
  to select an Arrival Date, then you may delete all Arrival Dates.</p>

  <h2>Creating Arrival Dates</h2>

  <p>Here are examples of the three types of Arrival Dates that you can create:</p>

  <p><strong>At Once:</strong> This type of arrival date is the default for most websites
  that ship their products as soon as possible and the arrival date is not important.</p>

  <p>TIP: To create an "At Once" Arrival Date, set the Arrival Date field to
  "00/00/0000".</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you create an "At Once" Arrival Date, all Shipping Methods that are
  available to deliver all Products to each recipient's address (each Product's Allowed
  Shipping Zones intersects with the Shipping Method's Allowed Shipping Zones), will be
  offer the the Customer, no matter how many transit days the deliver might take.</p>

  <p>IMPORTANT: You should only have one "At Once" Arrival Date ("00/00/0000") enabled at
  any time on your website.</p>

  <p><strong>Christmas:</strong> This type of arrival date is for gift giving sites when
  the Product must arrive on or before a specific holiday. &nbsp;You can enable as many
  of these Arrival Dates as necessary at any time.</p>

  <p>TIP: To create a "Christmas" Arrival Date, set the Arrival Date field to 12/25/XXXX
  (where XXXX is the current year).</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you create a "Christmas" Arrival Date, only Shipping Methods that are
  available to deliver all Products to each recipient's address (each Product's Allowed
  Shipping Zone intersects with the Shipping Method's Allowed Shipping Zone), on or
  before 12/25/XXXX.</p>

  <p>TIP: Arrival Date/Shipping Method combinations allows the website to automatically
  switch between "standard" or "expedited" Shipping Methods for your Customers when
  orders are placed close to the Requested Arrival Date (i.e.&nbsp;holiday). Going
  further, the website will not allow the Customer to order if they are attempting to
  place an Order too close to the Requested Arrival Date (i.e.holiday) and no Shipping
  Methods are found that can get the Products to the destination in time.</p>

  <p>TIP: Use the Arrival Dates Start Date/End Date features to tell the website when to
  automatically remove and add Arrival Date options for your Customers. &nbsp;So when its
  too late to order for Christmas, that option can disappear and the option to order for
  Valentine's Day can appear. &nbsp;Using these features, you can preset many future
  occasions in advance.</p>

  <p><strong>Special Date:</strong>&nbsp;This type of arrival date is for gift giving
  sites when the Product must arrive on or before the Customer's own specific occasion
  (i.e. birthday, anniversary, event).</p>

  <p>TIP: To create a "Special Date" Arrival Date, set the Arrival Date's Display Custom
  Field.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you create a "Special Date" Arrival Date, the Customer will be prompted to
  enter their own date, and only Shipping Methods that are available to deliver all
  Products to each recipient's address (each Product's Allowed Shipping Zone intersects
  with the Shipping Method's Allowed Shipping Zone), on or before the date entered by the
  Customer.</p>

  <p>IMPORTANT: You should only have one Arrival Date using the "Display Custom
  Field"&nbsp;enabled at any time on your website.</p>
