        TIP: Be mindful that the area of visible Ad Content may be restricted and may
        change depending on the Ad Region you select. This is typically&nbsp;done by the
        Web Designer so that the size of the Ad Content cannot alter any Page's
        layout.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: Ad Regions are either "Static" (they will&nbsp;display one Ad each time a
        Page is displayed), or "Dynamic" (they will display multiple Ads w/Labels each
        time a Page is displayed).</td>

        Order (below).<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: Labels are ONLY displayed within Ad Regions that are "Dynamic". &nbsp;They
        are hidden if the Ad Region is "Static". Labels can be styled,&nbsp;positioned,
        and even hidden&nbsp;using CSS by a&nbsp;Site Designer.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Caption:</td>

        <td>You have the option of adding a caption which will appear on a layer above
        the Ad. This is useful if your Ad contains a photo and you want to add some text
        about the photo. By default, the caption will appear at the bottom of the Ad.
        Captions can be styled, positioned, and even hidden using CSS by a Site Designer.
        Captions only appear for dynamic Ad Regions (not static). Also, captions will
        fade when the Ads switch regardless of whether the Ads slide or fade.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
  IMPORTANT: At least one Ad Region must be defined by a Site Designer before Ads can be
  created.</p>
