  <h1>Custom Form Page Type</h1>

  <p>Custom Form Page Types allow you to create and collect custom forms like: event
  registrations, product registrations, surveys, sales and support inquiries, request
  forms, and many others.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>

          <p>Form Name:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>The is the unique name of the Custom Form that is embedded in the
          Page.&nbsp; It is used to identify the form's data captured and accessible in
          the [FORMS] area, and to connect the optional Custom Form Confirmation
          Page.</p>

          <p>NOTE: The Form Name can be changed at any time as long as you have deleted
          all submitted form data associated with the Custom Form.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Select this when you want the Custom Form to collect submitted data.&nbsp;
          If this is not selected, the Custom Form and it's submit button will not appear
          within the Page.</p>

        <td>Select this option if you want to add "Quiz Question" fields to the Custom
        Form. &nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        This option prevents the submitter from reaching the confirmation message or next
        Page until they answer a certain percentage of the "Quiz Questions" correctly.
        This is useful for creating certification tests and displaying a certificate of
        completion ONLY if they obtain a passing percentage.&nbsp;If the submitter does
        not complete the correct percentage, they remain on the Custom Form page and a
        message is displayed.&nbsp;The Custom Form is submitted regardless of the
        percentage scored so that quiz administrators can audit the number of attempts
        and keep track of each score.</td>

          <p>This optional setting adjusts the horizontal width (in percent) of the label
          column within the Custom Form area of the Page.&nbsp; Use this setting to
          improve your form's layout.</p>

          select the Form Item View Page where the Submitted Form will appear and where
          Comments and watching are enabled.</p>

          <p>TIP: This feature is often used for a forum where the User who submits a
          thread might want to be notified about all replies to that thread.</p>

        the system cannot find an e-mail address for the Submitter, then an e-mail will

  <h2>Work-flow features of Custom Forms</h2>

  <p>Custom Forms include built-in work-flow features, allowing you to create
  auto-responders easily, display confirmations for printing, and even send the form's
  confirmation to the Submitter and/or to other staff member to alert them each time a
  Custom Form is submitted.<br />
  <br />
  Custom Forms work like all other Pages, which allow you to chain Custom Form Pages
  together or with other Page Types to easily create your own custom work flows.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Create or update the Submitter's User and Contact
  Information</span><br />
  <br />
  When a Custom Form is submitted successfully, a new Contact is created and the Contact
  is added to the "Add to Contact Group" group if it is specified. If a Contact is found
  for the Submitter (i.e. the Submitter has already logged in), then any Custom Form
  field that has the optional "Connect to Contact" field property selected will update
  the Contact's data automatically.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Send optional confirmation/information to
  Submitter</span><br />
  <br />
  When a Custom Form is submitted successfully, the optional "E-mail Submitter" fields
  can be specified and the system will send an e-mail each time the Custom Form is
  submitted successfully. If a Custom Form Confirmation Page is selected to be e-mailed,
  then the system will include the Submitters form data (from the current browser
  session) based on the Confirmation Pages associated "Custom Form" property. If the Page
  is not a Custom Form Confirmation Type, then the system will simply send the Page
  without any form data.<br />
  <br />
  NOTE: This auto-responder feature requires that you create a field that is connected to
  the Contact e-mail address field.&nbsp; Otherwise, the system will NOT send the
  e-mail.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Send optional confirmation/notification to
  Administrator(s)</span><br />
  <br />
  When a Custom Form is submitted successfully, the optional "E-mail Administrator"
  fields can be specified and the system will send an e-mail each time the Custom Form is
  submitted successfully. If a Custom Form Confirmation Page is selected, then the system
  will include the Submitters form data based on the Confirmation Pages associated
  "Custom Form" property. If the Page is not a Custom Form Confirmation Type, then the
  system will simply send the Page without any form data.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">4) Show confirmation message or go to another
  Page</span><br />
  <br />
  When a Custom Form is submitted successfully then a confirmation message can be shown
  or, if the next Page property is specified, the Submitter will be redirected to the
  next page.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">5) Make the confirmation message or next Page
  conditional by selecting the Enable Quiz option.</span><br />
  <br />
  This is useful for creating certification tests and displaying a certificate of
  completion ONLY if they obtain a passing percentage.&nbsp; If the submitter does not
  complete the correct percentage, they remain on the Custom Form page and a message is
  displayed.&nbsp; The Custom Form is submitted regardless of the percentage scored so
  that quiz administrators can audit the number of attempts and each score.</p>

  <h2>Custom Form Behaviors</h2>

  <p>Custom Forms are flexible, allowing you to create many form processes for your
  specific needs by linking them together with each other and with other Page Types to
  customize your site's work flow.<br />
  <br />
  Custom Forms share data with Contacts, so that data collected can be pre-filled and
  used to populate Contact information and My Account information, and other Custom
  Forms.<br />
  <br />
  Custom Forms are work flow-enabled, allowing you to e-mail confirmations, create
  auto-responders, and send alerts to the Submitter and to your staff whenever a
  particular Custom Form is submitted.<br />
  <br />
  Each Custom Form can also have one or more Custom Form Confirmation Pages associated
  with them to display and/or e-mail a Custom Form's data to the Submitter, and to notify
  your staff of the completed form.&nbsp; This is ideal for displaying (and e-mailing)
  the Custom Form data collected to the Submitter, along with a unique confirmation
  number for future reference.<br />
  <br />
  A Custom Form cannot be deleted if any of it's submitted data exists.&nbsp; If no form
  data exists, then the Page is allowed to be deleted or the Page Type is allowed to be
  changed.<br />
  <br />
  When a Page containing a Custom Form is duplicated, the underlying Form Definition
  (fields and their values) is also duplicated into the new Page.&nbsp; The duplicated
  Page and embedded Custom Form are not related to the original Page or Custom
  Form.&nbsp; You can rename the Custom Form at any time, just like the duplicated
  Page.<br />
  <br />
  If you need to temporarily or permanently disable a Custom Form from collecting new
  data, you can edit the Page containing the Custom Form and set it's Page Type
  Properties.<br />
  <br />
  Files uploaded using Custom Forms will be deleted automatically when the Submitted Form
  is deleted.</p>

  <h2>Securing Custom Forms &amp; Submitted Form Data Collected</h2>

  <p>Since Custom Forms are integrated into Pages, each Custom Forms is embedded into a
  Page and shares the Page's security. By simply moving the Page containing a Custom Form
  to a different Folder, you can control the access to submit, view, and edit Custom
  Forms and their associated data.<br />
  <br />
  Any User that has "Edit" rights to a Folder that contains the Custom Form Page, can
  edit the Custom Form AND it's data.<br />
  <br />
  Any Visitor or User with "View" rights to a Folder containing a Custom View Page Type,
  can view form data it displays REGARDLESS of their access rights to the Folder where
  the Custom Form Page resides.&nbsp; Be sure that you limit the View Designer to include
  only data that you want to display to the Visitor or User.<br />
  <br />
  Any User with "Edit" rights to a Folder containing a Custom View Page will also see an
  [Edit] button on the bottom of the page when viewing it. They can click on the edit
  button to edit the selected Forms Custom View Data Page Type.<br />
  <br />
  Files uploaded using Custom Forms are assigned to specified Folders, thus all access
  rights to the Folder also apply to the uploaded files.</p>

  <h2>SPAM Protection</h2>

  <p>Spammers use unprotected web forms in an attempt to use another's website to post
  and broadcast their own advertising. To combat this malicious technique, if CAPTCHA is
  enabled in the Site Settings then all Custom Forms have a built-in CAPTCHA feature that
  is automatically enabled if a Custom Form is displayed to any site visitor that has is
  not logged into the website. The CAPTCHA asks a simple challenge question that the
  visitor must answer correctly in order to submit the Custom Form.</p>

  <h2>Disconnect from Contact Feature</h2>

  <p>There are times when your staff may need to submit a Custom Form on behalf of
  another person or User. When this occurs, any "Connect to Contact" fields in the Custom
  Form will overwrite the Submitter's Contact information. In this case, the "Connect to
  Contact" feature is undesirable. To disable this feature, a special value
  ("connect_to_contact=false") can be added to any Custom Form Page link to disable this
  feature for any Submitted Form:</p>

  <p>Example: "/pages/custom_form_page?connect_to_contact=false"</p>

  <p><a href="0090_edit_page_properties.html" onclick=
  "update_help_content('0090_edit_page_properties'); return false;" style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Back to Edit Page Properties</a></p>
</body>
