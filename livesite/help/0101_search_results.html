  <h1>Search Results Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Search Results Page Type displays search results from Pages, Comments, Submitted
  Forms &amp; Views, Products, Calendars &amp; Events, and even content from within Files
  linked or attached to website pages.</p>

  <p>There are two types of Site Search: Simple and Advanced. Each have their
  benefits. Here is a chart that compares each Site Search Type. You can select the
  method best for you in your Site Settings. Simple Site Search is enabled by
  default.</p>

        them to be searchable. They also must not be Design Files and must not be in an
        Archive Folder. If comments are enabled for any included Page, any File
        Attachments found will also be indexed.<br />
        <br />
        All types of files are included in the index, however the system only indexes the
        content of the following types of files: doc, docx, pdf, ppt, pptx, txt, xls, and
        xlsx. This means that even though zip file content is not stored in the
        index, someone can still search for a zip file by name and find it.<br />
        <br />
        PDF is the only type of file that requires an external library to be
        installed. It requires pdftotext. Please ask your Server
        Administrator to install it for you if you need to index PDF files.<br />
        <br />
        For MS Office documents, it is recommended that you use the "x" format, because
        the system will be able to extract text for those more accurately. For example,
        use docx instead of doc, pptx instead of ppt, and xlsx instead of xls.<br />
        <br />
        The Description value from an uploaded File (see Files Tab) is used for the
        search results description. If that is blank, then the first part of the
        content of the File is used for the description.</td>

        the search term appears in the title or description of a result, and not just the
        content, then that result is given a higher score.</td>
