  <h1>Form Item View Page Type</h1>

  <p>Form Item View Page Type displays a single row of data collected from a single
  Custom Form (a submitted form).&nbsp; You can define a layout for the fields you want
  to display. Not all data collected on a form must be visible, you can decide which
  item's are visible and even mask or hide some fields.<br />
  <br />
  Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Allow only submitter and watchers to view his/her submitted form(s):</td>

        <td>Select this option if you would like only the Submitter of the original
        submitted form data along with any specified Watchers to have access to view the
        submitted form data.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: This is useful for creating private conversation threads where the submitted
        form data could contain sensitive information and needs to be shared only with
        the Submitter and those to have been added as Watchers by either the Submitter or
        Site Manager.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Allow any registered user to edit submitted form(s):</td>

        <td>Select this option if you would like the form data (that appears in the Form
        Item View Page to be editable by any registered User.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: This is useful for creating a simple Wiki, allowing those that have view
        access to the Page to make updates, even through they may not have any content
        management rights.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Allow submitter to edit his/her submitted form(s):</td>

        <td>Select this option if you want only the Submitter of the original submitted
        form data to edit their own information.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: This is useful for creating a member directory, so each member can keep
        their own information current, even through they don't have content management
        access.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><br />
  <span style="font-style: italic;">To design your Form View Page's layout of the data
  fields and add any data filters, put the Page into "Edit Mode" or edit the Page
  Properties, and then edit the embedded Form View.<br />
  <br /></span></p>

  <h2>Setting up a Form Item View Page</h2>

  <p>If you are linking a Form Item View Page from a Form List View Page, then first,
  make sure you have selected this Form Item View Page in the Form List View's Page
  properties. Then edit your Form List View Page and create a link to the Form Item View
  Page using this format:</p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">^^form_item_view^^</p>

  <p>The system will then automatically create a URL with the Page name and reference
  code, thus connecting the referenced row of data from the Submitted Form to the Form
  Item View.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you selected a Form Item view Page to be e-mailed when a Custom Form is
  submitted, then the Form Item View Page will display the data from the Custom Form that
  was submitted. Also, if a Form Item View Page is selected to be the Next Page for the
  Custom Form, then when the User submits the Custom Form they will be sent to the Form
  Item View Page with the appropriate Reference Code.</p>

  <h2>Editing the Submitted Form</h2>

  <p>If the Visitor has access to edit the Submitted Form that appears on this Form Item
  View, then an edit button will appear that allows the Visitor to edit the Submitted
  Form from the front-end. The Visitor will only be able to edit Fields that appear in
  the layout of this Form Item View.</p>

  <p>For file upload Fields, if there is no existing file, then you can upload a File. If
  there is an existing file, you can replace the File and possibly delete it. The delete
  option only appears if the Field is optional (i.e. not required). If the Field is
  required and you need to delete the File, you can temporarily update the Field to be
  optional or you can delete the File from the Files tab, if you have access.</p>

  "update_help_content('0090_edit_page_properties'); return false;" style=
