  <h1>Edit Custom Form</h1>

  <p>There are several different field types that can be added to any Custom Form.&nbsp;
  Each field type has properties to allow you to collect many different types of
  information.</p>

  <p>To edit any existing Custom Form field, select the Field. &nbsp;To add a new Custom
  Form Field, click "Create Form Field".</p>

  <p>NOTE: A Custom Form Field cannot be deleted if any Submitted Form has been captured
  that includes data for this field. To delete a field, you must first delete all the
  submitted form data for this Custom Form. &nbsp;(This limitation is not true for
  Product Forms, which can be modified at any time, without deleting their corresponding
  submitted Orders.)</p>
