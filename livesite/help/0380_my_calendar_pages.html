  <h1>My Calendar Pages</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Pages that you have access to that also are defined as
  "Calendar View" and "Calendar Event View" Page Types.</p>

  <p>Calendar Pages display all the published Events for one or more Calendars.</p>

  <h2>Calendar View Pages</h2>

  <p>Calendar View Pages work with submitted Calendar Events.&nbsp; Calendar Views allow
  you to filter and display Events from one or more Calendars, and the Visitor can select
  the date range, overlay all Calendars, and select a monthly or weekly view.</p>

  <h2>Calendar Event View Pages</h2>

  <p>Calendar Event View Pages display the full details of a single Calendar Event.&nbsp;
  These optional Pages must be displayed by linking to them from an Event on a Calendar
  View Page, since the link to the Event is generated by the system.</p>

  <p>To create a Calendar Page, create a Page and set the Page Type Property to "Calendar
  View" or "Calendar Event View". You can create as many Calendar Pages as you need.</p>

  <h2>RSS-Enabled Calendars</h2>

  <p>RSS is enabled automatically for any Calendar Page that is in a Public Folder. When
  enabled, the soonest 50 upcoming Calendar Events across all Calendars displayed on the
  Page are included in the RSS feed. RSS Elements found in the Calendar feeds are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Channel Title: Page's Web Browser Title.</li>

    <li>Channel Description: Page's Web Browser Description.</li>

    <li>Item Category: Calendar's Name.</li>

    <li>Item Title: Calendar Event's Name.</li>

    <li>Item Description: Calendar Event's Short Description.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>iCalendar</h2>

  <p>Calendar Item View Page visitors can export calendar events to their desktop
  calendar application such as Microsoft Outlook. On every Calendar Event View Page there
  will be an "iCalendar" link, and when clicked it will download an ICS file to their
  local computer and import this ICS file into their desktop calendar application.</p>
