          A Page's interactive features are determined by it's "Page Type". &nbsp;Page
          Types turn simple web pages into data-driven pages like an order form page,

          directory, etc.<br />
          <br />
          By linking Pages with different Page Types together, you can create customized
          website applications without any programming knowledge. Keep in mind that some
          Page Types are designed to be chained to other,&nbsp;specific Page Types.<br />

          website so that Visitors can find your website.<br />
          <br />
          The Pages's Folder must have a Public Access Control Type and not be archived
          in order for the Page to appear in the sitemap.xml file. Also the Page must
          have one of the following Page Types: Standard, Folder View, Photo Gallery,
          Search Results, Custom Form, Form List View, Form Item View, Form View
          Directory, Calendar View, Calendar Event View, Catalog, Catalog Detail, Express
          Order, Order Form, or Shopping Cart.<br />
          <br />
          This feature offers the following advantages.<br />

          <ul>
            <li>This system will automatically notify all major search engines (i.e.
            Google, Bing/Yahoo!, Ask.com) daily if the sitemap.xml file has changed. This
            means that Visitors from search engines will find new content at your website
            sooner. This also means that you do not have to manually submit your website
            to search engines or wait for other sites to link to your website in order
            for search engines to find it.</li>

            <li>Sometimes search engines are not able to find all URL's at a website.
            This might be because content is linked in JavaScript or Flash or there might
            be an area of content that is not linked on the website. The sitemap.xml file
            ensures that search engines know about every URL at your website.</li>

            <li>The sitemap.xml file contains information about when an item was last
            modified so search engines don't have to crawl URL's that have not changed,
            so this saves bandwidth and improves site performance.</li>

            <li>The sitemap.xml file contains priority information in order to give the
            home page(s) the highest priority. This means that search engines can make
            sure to crawl your home page first in case they are too busy to crawl your
            whole website at the moment.</li>

            <li>For Catalog, Form List View, and Calendar View Pages, all items that
            appear through those Pages will also be included in the sitemap.xml file. For
            example, if a Product appears on a Catalog Page, then a URL to the Catalog
            Detail Page for that Product will be included in the sitemap.xml file. This
            means that search engines will be able to find all items that appear on your
            website (i.e. Product Groups, Products, Submitted Forms, Calendar
            Events).</li>

            <li>This system has a robots.txt file which tells search engines where the
            sitemap.xml file is located in order to make sure that all search engines can
            find the sitemap.xml file.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>NOTES:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The sitemap.xml file should include every Page at your website that you
            want search engines to know about, not just the most important Pages.
            Normally, all public Pages should be included. However, if you happen to have
            public Pages that you only want to share with a few people, then do not
            include those Pages.</li>

            <li>Search engines are only notified if there is at least one Page included
            in the sitemap.xml file, in case you do not want search engines to know about
            your website.</li>

            <li>Files are not currently included in the sitemap.xml file (only
            Pages).</li>

            <li>The sitemap.xml file may be accessed at the following location:<br />
            <br />
            http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml</li>

          <h3>Comments Feature</h3>

          <p>The Comments feature adds online community-building functionality to any
          Page on your site. Comments allow Visitors and Users to interact with your
          site. If Comments are enabled for a Page, then anyone who can view a Page can
          leave a Comment (and therefore become a Contributor), and read any published
          Comments from other Contributors. Comments can be automatically published, or
          the Page's Moderator (a User with edit rights to the Page), can be alerted via
          e-mail to new Comments with a link to instantly edit, delete or publish the
          Comment.</p>

          <p>NOTE: Comments are tied directly to a Page. However, some Pages, depending
          on their Page Type, display dynamic items, so their Comments are tied to both
          the Page and the dynamic item. This is transparent to the Visitors, but worth
          mentioning as you are deciding which Pages you should enable Comments for.
          Pages with the following Page Types display dynamic items: Catalog, Catalog
          Detail, Form Item View, and Calendar Event View.</p>

          <p>NOTE: If CAPTCHA is enabled in the Site Settings and if a visitor is not
          logged in and the Page has either a Public or Guest Access Control Type, then a
          Captcha field will automatically be displayed in the Add Comment area of the
          Page. The Captcha field is a randomly generated question that must be answered
          before the Comment can be added. This is to protect the Comments feature from
          being spammed.</p>

          <p>IMPORTANT: To display comments, a System Region or
          &lt;system&gt;&lt;/system&gt; tag must appear in the Page Style assigned to the
          Page. The Site Designer can add this tag if necessary.</p>

          <p>TIP: This feature is useful when you want to set up a single Custom Form to
          manage requests for several internal groups. Each time a Comment (i.e.

          field on the Custom Form where the Connect to Contact property is set to E-mail

          e-mail address.</p>

        selected Page. The Site Designer can add the tag if necessary.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 4em;">Subject:</td>

        <td>
          This is the subject line of the e-mail.<br />
          <br />
          TIP: For Form Item View Pages, you may also include the name of any custom
          field in the associated Custom Form to create a dynamic subject that contains
          submitted form data. Example: <em>^^subject^^</em>: A comment has been added.
          You can also use the following format to include different content depending on
          whether there is a value for a custom form field or not:

          <p>[[Subject is ^^<span style="font-style: italic;">subject</span>^^||There is
          no subject]]</p>

          <p>You can use the following format to customize the date format for date and
          date &amp; time fields. The format must be a <a href=
          "http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php" target="_blank">PHP date
          format</a>.</p>

          <p>Format:<br />
          ^^field_name^^%%format%%</p>

          <p>Example:<br />
          ^^submitted_date_and_time^^%%l, F j, Y \a\t g:i A%%</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 2em;">Allow submitter to manage watchers:</td>

        <td>Check this box to allow each custom form Submitter to add/remove Watchers
        from their submitted forms (through a Form Item View Page).<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This feature is only enabled if "E-mail watchers when a comment is
        published:" is also enabled (see above).</td>

  <h2>Deleting a Page</h2>

  <p>When a Page is deleted, a warning message is displayed, and if "Continue" is
  selected,&nbsp;the Page, its Page Region content, and all of its Comments will be
  deleted from the system's database.</p>

  <p>TIP: If you might want to archive the Page Region content, we recommend that you
  place the Page in a Private Folder (so no one can view or edit it) instead of deleting
  it.</p>

  <p>NOTE: When a Page is deleted, only the Page Regions and Comments are deleted. Any
  Common Regions, Page Style, Page Type, etc., are NOT deleted.&nbsp; The Page, its Page
  Regions, and its Comments are gone!</p>

  <p>NOTE: The delete button only appears for Users that have access to delete Pages.</p>

  <p>WARNING: Be careful because there is no undelete!&nbsp;</p>
