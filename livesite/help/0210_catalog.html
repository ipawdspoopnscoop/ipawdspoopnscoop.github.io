  <h1>Catalog Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Catalog Page Type is designed to allow your Customers to browse and search your
  online catalogs of Products and Product Groups, from a single Page.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Product Group:</p>
        </td>

        <td>The Catalog Page will start with this Product Group as the parent when the
        Page is first displayed. &nbsp;Leave this field unselected if you want to start
        with the top-most Product Group of the website as the parent when the Page is
        first displayed.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Enable Menu:</td>

        <td>Select this if you want a menu to appear on the Catalog page that allows
        Customers to quickly browse to a Product Group. All Product Groups, starting with
        the Product Group that was selected above, where the Display Type is "Display
        contents for browsing on catalog page" will be included in the menu. Products are
        not included in the menu.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Enable Search:</td>

        <td>
          <p>Select this if you want a search field to appear on the Catalog page that
          allows Customers to quickly find Product Groups and Products. The search
          feature will only search for items under the Product Group that was selected
          above. Also, it will only search for items that appear on Catalog Detail pages
          (i.e. Product Groups where the Display Type is "Display contents for selection
          on catalog detail page" and Products).</p>

          <p>The following fields for Product Groups and Products are searched.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Search Keywords</li>

            <li>Name/ID/SKU</li>

            <li>Short Description</li>

            <li>Full Description</li>

            <li>Details</li>

            <li>Web Browser Keywords</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The fields above are listed in order of importance in determining search
          relevance, from most important to least important. For example, if the search
          feature finds a match in Search Keywords for Product A and a match in Details
          for Product B, then Product A will appear in the search results before Product
          B, because Search Keywords is more important than Details. In order to generate
          a match, the keywords that the Customer enters only have to match part of the
          data in a field, so, for example, if a Customer searches for "shirt" and a
          Product contains "t-shirt" for Search Keywords, then that will result in a
          match.</p>

          <p>TIP: If you want to improve the quality of the search results for your
          Customers we recommend that you add Search Keywords to your Product Groups and
          Products that match the types of keywords that your Customers might enter to
          find a Product.</p>

          <p>If the search feature finds a match for a Product that is in a Product
          Group, where the Display Type is "Display contents for selection on catalog
          detail page", then the Product Group will appear in the search results instead
          of the Product.</p>

          <p>If a Product Group or Product has Search Keywords, then the keywords will be
          displayed on the Catalog Detail Page with links to search results for each
          keyword, even if search is disabled for the Catalog Page. If you want to fully
          disable search then you should uncheck this check box and remove search
          keywords from Product Groups and Products.</p>

        &nbsp;However, if you want to allow your Customers to also purchase online, you
        will need to connect your Catalog Page to a Catalog Detail Page. &nbsp;This will
        allow them to reach the Add to Cart features.</td>

  <h2>Setting up a Catalog</h2>

  <p>The Catalog Page is a powerful feature that lets your Customers browse and search an
  unlimited number Product Groups&nbsp; and Products.&nbsp;All the display and navigation
  is built-in, so you don't have to create a Page for each and every Product and Product
  Group. Instead, a single Catalog Page can list and navigate through an unlimited number
  of Product Groups and Products.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Browsing a Catalog:</span> When you create a
  Catalog Page, you specify the starting, or parent Product Group. &nbsp;Product Groups
  for Products are like Folders are to Pages. &nbsp;You can place children Product Groups
  and Products into a parent Product Group. This relationship is used by the Catalog Page
  to first display the parent Product Group and then allow the Customer to drill down
  into it's children Product Groups and Products.&nbsp;If you want to change the way a
  Catalog Page navigates or the Products it displays, simply move the Products and
  Product Groups around. <span style="font-style: italic;">You must have Commerce Manager
  rights to do this.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buying from a Catalog</span>: When you create a
  Catalog Page, you can optionally specify a Catalog Detail Page. &nbsp;If you do this,
  the Customer will be able to not only browse the Catalog, but also add any Products in
  the Catalog to their Cart.</p>

  <p>TIP: Since the logic that drives the browsing/buying is defined within each Catalog
  Page, you can create unlimited Catalog Pages,&nbsp;each with different features.
  &nbsp;If you then put these Pages into access-controlled Folders, you can create
  catalogs for different audiences. &nbsp;For example, a catalog for public shopping, and
  a private catalog for members or resellers only, and even a catalog unique to a
  specialized customer.</p>

  <p>TIP: You can also use a Catalog Page to create a dynamically changing catalog of
  media! To do this, simply create a Product for each media item, set it's Price to
  "0.00", and set it's Selection Type to "Donation". This will surpress the ecommerce
  features for the Page.</p>
