  <h1>All Design Files</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Design Files that have been uploaded into the system.
  &nbsp;Design files are typically image files, javascript files,&nbsp;flash files, site
  banners, or any other file that you might need to use in your site design.</p>

  <p>Design Files are stored in the same Folders as other Files, but they are not
  accessible to Content Managers so they don't clutter File selection in the Rich-text
  Editor, and cannot be modified or deleted by Content Managers or Site Managers
  accidentally.</p>

  <p>Design Files share the same access control of the Folder they are placed into.</p>

  <h2>Viewing &amp; Editing Design Files</h2>

  <p>You can view and edit any File you have access to by selecting the File from any of
  the All Design Files screen.</p>

  <h2>Modifying Design Files</h2>

  <p>You can modify the Folder and design property for one or more Design Files by
  selecting the Design Files you wish to modify and clicking "Modify Selected".</p>

  <p>WARNING: Since changing a Design File's Folder affects its access control, you can
  accidentally make a Private Design File accessible or a Public Design File inaccessible
  to others attempting to view the Design File. Keep this in mind when moving Design
  Files among Folders.</p>

  <h2>Searching Design Files</h2>

  <p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for any Design File
  by it's properties.</p>

  <h2>Creating Design Files</h2>

  <p>To create a File, click on "Upload Design Files".</p>

  <h2>Deleting Design Files</h2>

  <p>To delete a File from the web server, select the File you wish to delete and click
  "Delete Selected".</p>

  <p>NOTE:&nbsp;If you delete a File, any links or references to the File will need to be
  updated.</p>

  <p>WARNING:&nbsp;Take care when deleting Design Files, there is no undo. &nbsp;If you
  are using the Theme feature, and the Design File you delete is referenced by the
  currently active Theme, then your website may not be displayed correctly.</p>

  <h2>Adding a Favicon</h2>

  <p>A favicon is the name for the tiny graphical image that appears within the address
  bar of your web browser when viewing some websites. Favicons are typically a tiny
  version of your logo and help visitors to identify that they are viewing your website
  and can help to increase your brand. You can prepare a favicon by creating a square
  image and saving it as a .png or .gif file. Then visit one of the many free favicon
  generator websites which will create a special favicon.ico file from your image. Then
  simply upload the favicon.ico file as a Design File (be sure it is placed in a Public
  Folder) and the system will automatically use it as the favicon for your website.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Files that have been archived are italicized.</p>
