  <h1>My Registration Access Pages</h1>

  <p>These Pages have been placed in a Registration Folder, which provides you an easy
  way of prompting your site Visitors to register with the website before proceeding on
  the the Page they requested.<br />
  <br />
  Whenever a site Visitor attempts to access a one of these Pages, and they are not
  logged in, the Registration Entrance Page will be displayed, and they will be required
  to either register or login, before continuing on to the Page they requested.<br />

  To create a Registration Access Page, simply move any Page into a Registration
  Folder.</p>
