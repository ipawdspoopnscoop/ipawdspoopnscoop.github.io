  <h1>Edit Theme</h1>

  <p>Edit the CSS File to the web server. Themes are CSS files that are created by the
  Theme Designer (System Themes) or by uploading a CSS file into the system (Custom
  Themes). Here are the properties:</p>

        can instantly change the look and feel of you entire website with a click of a
        button by activating a Theme from this screen.<br />

        WARNING: If you activate a Theme that doesn't work with your HTML Page Styles
        correctly, you could render your website unreadable. If this happens, activate
        another Theme until you can fix the problematic Theme.</td>

  <h2>Previewing Themes</h2>

  <p>You can apply any Theme to you website without activating it first. This means that
  you can browse your actual public website Pages through the new Theme, without any
  other website Visitor being affected. All other Visitors will see the active Theme.
  This "Theme Preview Mode" is enabled until you close your browser (end your session),
  or activate a Theme.</p>

  <h2>Deleting Themes</h2>

  <p>To delete a Theme from the web server, click on the Theme you wish to delete and
  click "Delete".</p>

  <p>WARNING: Take care when deleting Theme files, there is no undo. Don't delete an
  active Theme or you will render your website unreadable (if you are using Themes in
  your Page Styles. If this happens, activate another Theme.</p>

  <p>TIP: Use Theme Preview Mode (found through the [Pages] tab) to help you develop and
  test new Themes without affecting your "live" website.</p>

  <h2>Custom Format Feature</h2>

  <p>To further control the consistency of the content added by Content Managers, we have
  created a number of Custom Formats that are made available to your Content Managers
  when editing content using the Rich-text Editor's "Format" selections.</p>

  <p>If are using the built-in stylesheet-driven website themes, then you have access to
  a series of styling for different types of content we have created for you. Each style
  becomes a Custom Format that you can apply them to your content. (However, you can
  still override any Custom Formats by adding your own CSS to the Advanced Styling area
  through the Theme Designer).</p>

  <p>So that your content would be portable from one Theme to another, we devised a
  system based on a two-tone color scheme. In a two-tone color scheme, there is a
  "primary" and "secondary" color. We have taken that concept to develop primary and
  secondary buttons, boxes, links, and other common website styles. This allows you to
  extend this concept to your own website designs and style guides so that all content
  will work across all themes!</p>

  <p>TIP: You should use these custom formats instead of "Fonts", "Font Styles", and
  "Font Sizes" which are disabled by default and are not compatible with the system
  themes and web content standards.</p>

  <p>NOTE: We have included several custom formats within the system provided themes to
  help you add more pazazz to your content. We have also added a Tag Picker to help you
  more easily "grab" content to style.</p>

  <h3>Adding Custom Formats to Custom Themes</h3>

  <p>If you uploaded your own CSS Theme, then you can add Custom Formats to the Rich-text
  Editor by adding the &lt;custom_formats&gt;&lt;/custom_formats&gt; tags within CSS
  comments in your Custom Theme files, like this:</p>

  <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/* &lt;custom_formats&gt;
  */</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" />
  <br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" />
  <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">define
  your CSS custom formats here...<br />
  <br /></span> <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/*
  &lt;/custom_formats&gt; */</span></p>

  <p>NOTE: Be sure that the &lt;custom format&gt; and &lt;/custom_format&gt; comments are
  spelled correctly and appear around the styles you want to make available to the
  Rich-text Editor or they will be ignored. (For an example, look at the CSS generated
  with every System Theme.)</p>

  <p>TIP: Once you have defined all necessary Custom Formats in your Theme, we recommend
  that you disable the Rich-text Editor menu buttons from the Site Settings to prevent
  your Content Managers from using fonts, colors, and styling that is inconsistent with
  the website's intended design.</p>
