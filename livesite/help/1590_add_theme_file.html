        NOTE: You can use Custom Themes with System Page Styles, you just need to look at
        the source of the System Page Styles created by the Style Designer and have a

        Theme Designer to create your new Theme.<br />

        "Import a System Theme." will allow you to import a System Theme CSV file. You
        can get a System Theme CSV file by first exporting a System Theme from the
        system. After importing a System Theme, you use the Theme Designer to modify the
        Theme.<br />

        NOTE: When importing a Theme CSV file, if the CSV file name matches the name of
        an existing Theme CSS file, then a confirmation will appear that will allow you
        to overwrite the existing Theme.</td>
