  <h1>Edit Form List View</h1>

  <p>This screen allows you to layout the display of data from multiple submitted forms.
  This is one of the most powerful features of the system.</p>

  <p>You can update the way this Page's displays of data from multiple Submitted Forms,
  and optionally link this Page to a Form Item View Page, that will display an individual
  submitted form, by using the ^^form_item_view^^ system field.</p>

  <h2>All available submitted form fields for display within View</h2>

  <p>All the available fields that can be displayed are listed, sandwiched between the
  double-caret (^^) which are used by the system to identify where to replace the fields
  with data when displaying the Page. Simply copy any of the fields (be sure to include
  the double-carets) into the Layout area.</p>

  <h3>System Fields</h3>

  <p>System Fields are fields that are available to include in your layout that are
  automatically created for all Submitted Form data.</p>

  <h3>Form Fields</h3>

  <p>Form Fields are fields where created on the Custom Form that the Custom Form List
  View Page is associated with (through it's Page Properties).</p>

  <h3>Comment Fields</h3>

  <p>There are several system fields which allow you to display information about
  Comments that have be added to Submitted Forms. These fields can be used to setup a
  forum that shows the number of replies and newest reply for various topics.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>^^number_of_comments^^: The total number of Comments that have been added to a
    Submitted Form.</li>

    <li>^^newest_comment_name^^: The name of the person who added the newest Comment. If
    the name field was left blank, then "Anonymous" will be displayed.</li>

    <li>^^newest_comment^^: A preview of the newest Comment (limited to 100
    characters).</li>

    <li>^^newest_comment_date_and_time^^: The date and time that the newest Comment was
    added.</li>

    <li>^^newest_comment_id^^: The ID for the newest Comment. This field can be used to
    link directly to the newest Comment (see below).</li>

    <li>^^newest_activity_date_and_time^^: If a Comment does not exist, then this is the
    date and time that the Submitted Form was submitted. Otherwise, if a Comment does
    exists, then this is the date and time that the newest Comment was added. If you are
    creating a forum then you will want to set the Order by to this field (descending),
    so that topics with the most recent activity will appear first in the list.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Use the following URL format to link directly to the newest Comment on the Form Item
  View Page:</p>

  <p>^^form_item_view^^#software_comment_^^newest_comment_id^^</p>

  <h3>Hints</h3>

  <p>Hints provide a quick way of cutting and pasting common layout values into your
  layout area.</p>

  <h2>Display layout of submitted form data fields within View</h2>

  <p>The Form List View Layout area, or "layout" is where you place your available fields
  to be replaced by the actual data fields from the Submitted Forms. The layout area
  represents a single submitted form's data. Think of this area as a row in a
  spreadsheet, or table. It will be output over and over until all the Submitted Forms
  are displayed.</p>

  <h3>Linking to a Form Item View Page</h3>

  <p>Most of the time, you will not only want to display the Submitted Form data in a
  List, but also allow your site visitors to "drill into" the actual Submitted Form data
  and view additional fields that are not added to the layout itself. To do this, create
  a link in the layout and set the "Link URL" value to ^^form_item_view^^. The system
  will then automatically create a URL with the Page name and reference code. If the link
  does not work then make sure that a Form Item View Page is set in the page properties
  for this Form List View.</p>

  <h3>Displaying Conditional Information</h3>

  <p>You can display information within the layout area based on a value being available
  to display. For example, you may want to hide the label of the field if it is not
  present the Submitted Form data. Use the following format to output different content
  depending on whether there is a value or not:</p>

  <p>[[There is a value: ^^<span style="font-style: italic;">example</span>^^ || There is
  not a value]]</p>

  <h3>Link to File Upload Field Data</h3>

  <p>If you have created a Custom Form with File Upload fields on it, you will need to
  dynamically link to them through the layout. To do this, use the following URL
  format:</p>

  <p>/files/^^<span style="font-style: italic;">example</span>^^ , where <span style=
  "font-style: italic;">example</span> is a form field that contains the name of the File
  uploaded.</p>

  <h3>Displaying Date/Time Values</h3>

  <p>You want to format your date and time values in different ways for spacing or
  affect. The system allows you to use virtually any format you desire. To customize the
  date and time values for the available time and date fields, use the following format
  within your layout:</p>

  <p>Format:<br />
  ^^field_name^^%%<em>format</em>%%</p>

  <p><em>format</em> can either be a <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php"
  target="_blank">PHP date format</a> or "relative" for a relative time (e.g. "2 minutes
  ago", "2 minutes from now").</p>

  <p>Examples:<br />
  ^^submitted_date_and_time^^%%l, F j, Y \a\t g:i A%%<br />
  ^^submitted_date_and_time^^%%relative%%</p>

  <p>NOTE: For "relative" date/time formatting, once the date goes beyond one month, the
  full date and/or time is displayed.</p>

  <h2>Sort order of submitted form data within View</h2>

  <p>You can sort the order in which the Submitted Form data (rows) are output.
  "Ascending" orders results from a-z/0-9, while "descending" orders results from
  z-a/9-0. Normally you will want to choose "alphabetical", however if the field you
  select contains only numbers (e.g. price, square footage), then you will want to select
  "numerical", so the results appear in the correct order. Numerical ordering works for
  both integer numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3) and decimal numbers (e.g. 0.75, 1.25, 10.333).</p>

  <p>NOTE: "Random" sort order is only available for the first sort order option but is
  useful if you want the rows of Submitted Form data to be displayed in a random order
  each time the Page is displayed.</p>

  <h2>Limit the amount of data within each View Page</h2>

  <p>You can limit the nuber of Submitted Forms (data rows) are displayed on the page. If
  you don't set the Maximum Number of Results Per Page, then the system will output
  pagination navigation automatically.</p>

  <h2>Define what submitted form data can be displayed by the View</h2>

  <p>You can add filters that define exactly which Submitted Forms (data rows) are
  displayed on the Page.</p>

  <p>TIP: If you wish to further filter a Form List View to only allow a Submitter to
  view their own Submitted Form data, add an E-Mail Address Field to your Custom Form and
  then add a Filter where the "Submitter" "is equal to" the "Viewer". This will allow you
  to place the Form List View Page into a Folder that many Users can view, but any
  Submitted Form data from other Users will be hidden for them.</p>

        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Check this to add a search box to the Form List View Page. Search will allow
          the Visitor to enter a keyword and the system will search all (filtered) Form
          List View data for the keyword and display the resulting Submitted Form data
          (rows) that contain that keyword.</p>

          <p>NOTE: The keyword search will search all system and custom form fields, not
          just fields that appear in the display layout above.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 2em;">
          <p>Enable Advanced Search:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Check this to allow the Visitor to search specific fields. A toggle button
          (i.e. +/-) will appear that allows the Visitor to expand or collapse the
          advanced search. The Visitor may use the keyword search and advanced search at
          the same time. You may define the fields that are available in the layout
          below.</p>

          <p>The results will only be filtered for the advanced search fields that the
          Visitor completes. If a Visitor leaves a field blank, then that field will be
          ignored.</p>

          <p>In general, fields will appear as they are defined in the Custom Form Field
          properties. For example, if a field has a text box type, then it will appear as
          a text box in the advanced search. There are some exceptions to this. For
          example, a text area field will appear in the advanced search as a text box,
          because the Visitor will not need a full text area to enter a search term.</p>

          <p>If a default/blank option does not exist for pick lists and radio button
          sets, a default/blank option will be added to the top of the lists. This allows
          a Visitor to leave the default option selected in order to ignore a field if
          he/she does not want to filter that field.</p>

          the Visitor from having to click the toggle to expand the advanced search. If
          you check this, the expand by default setting for the browse feature will be
          disabled because both areas cannot be expanded at the same time.</p>

          "descending" orders filters from most recent to oldest.</p>

          <p>Check the shortcut check box if you want the browse filters for that field
          to link directly to the Submitted Form on the Form Item View Page instead of
          refreshing this Form List View Page and showing the result. The shortcut will
          only be used if there is only one result for the browse filter. You must set a
          Form Item View on the Edit Page Properties screen for this Form List View Page
          in order for the shortcut to work.</p>

          <p>For "date" and "date &amp; time" fields, you may enter a format for the
          date. This allows you to customize the way that the date is displayed. The
          format must follow the syntax for the <a href=
          "http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php" target="_blank">PHP date
          format</a>. See examples below.</p>

          <p>Examples:<br />
          "l, F j, Y \a\t g:i A" for "Friday, May 24, 2013 at 3:00 PM"<br />
          "F Y" for "May 2013"</p>

          <p>Most of the date characters that PHP supports are supported in this feature.
          If you want a character to literally appear instead of being converted into a
          date value, then place a "\" character before it (see example above for
          "at").</p>

          <p>Another benefit of the date format is that it allows you to group date
          values together. For example, if you have a blog and you want a list of months
          (with years) to appear in order to create a blog archive, you can simply enter
          "F Y" and then you will get a list like the following: January 2013, February
          2013, March 2013. Your blog form would need to have a "publish date" custom
          field in order for this to work.</p>

          <p>You may leave the format field empty if you just want the default format
          (i.e. 05/24/2013 03:00 PM).</p>
