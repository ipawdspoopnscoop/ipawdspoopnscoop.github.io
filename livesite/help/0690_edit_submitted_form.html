  <h2>File Upload Fields</h2>

  <p>For file upload Fields, if there is no existing file, then you can upload a File. If
  there is an existing file, you can replace the File and possibly delete it. The delete
  option only appears if the Field is optional (i.e. not required). If the Field is
  required and you need to delete the File, you can temporarily update the Field to be
  optional or you can delete the File from the Files tab, if you have access.</p>
