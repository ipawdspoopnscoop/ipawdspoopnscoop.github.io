  <h1>Catalog Detail Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Catalog Detail Page Type is designed to allow your Customers to view and/or add
  any Product found in a catalog to their Cart from a single Page.<br />
  <br />
  Catalog Detail Pages display dynamic Product data and therefore must be displayed by a
  Catalog Page using the Catalog Page's "Catalog Detail Page" property.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Allow customer to add product to order:</td>

        <td>
          <p>Check this if you want to allow the Customer to order Products from this
          page. If you uncheck this then the Customer will only be able to view Product
          information.</p>

          <p>TIP: If you have a catalog of items that are not meant to be ordered online,
          then you should uncheck this field.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Add Button Label:</td>

        <td>If "Allow customer to add product to order" is selected, then specify the
        text that will be displayed on the "Add"&nbsp;to Cart button.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Next Page:</td>

        <td>If "Allow customer to add product to order" is selected, then specify the
        Page to send the Customer to after they click on the "Add" to Cart button.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: Typically this is the Shopping Cart Page or Express Order Page.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Back Button Label:</td>

        <td>Specify the text that will be displayed on the "Back"&nbsp;to Catalog Page
        button.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>TIP: You can also use a Catalog Detail Page (in conjunction with a Catalog Page) to
  create a dynamically changing catalog of media! To do this, simply create a Product for
  each media item, set it's Price to "0.00", and set it's Selection Type to "Donation".
  This will surpress the ecommerce features for the Page.</p>
