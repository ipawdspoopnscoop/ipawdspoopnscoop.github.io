  <h1>Create / Edit Contact Group</h1>

  <p>This screen displays the a Contact Group and e-mail subscription features.</p>

  <p>All Contacts are organized into Contact Groups. Contact Groups can be used to simply
  group Contacts together for purposes of organization or classification, but more
  commonly are to create mailing lists for sending e-mail Campaigns.</p>

  <p>If a Contact Group is used as a mailing list, then it can be "open" to any
  Subscribers, or "closed" to any new Subscribers.</p>

  <p>Open Subscriptions are ideal for&nbsp;creating numerous self-managed mailing lists
  covering many topics and allow any Subscriber to join the mailing list at any time.</p>

  <p>Closed Subscriptions are used for creating private mailing lists that are maintained
  by a Contact Manager or by the&nbsp;the system system's work-flow features. This allows
  you to create and manage Staff-Only mailing lists,&nbsp;Member-Only mailing lists, and
  Customer-Only mailing lists, etc.</p>

  <p>Here are the Properties of a Contact Group:</p>
