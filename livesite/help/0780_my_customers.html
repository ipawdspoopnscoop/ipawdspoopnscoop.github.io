  <p>This screen displays all Contacts that have placed an Order.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If the Order is deleted, this Contact will no longer show up on this
  screen.</p>

  <p>TIP: You can always track your Customers using Contact Groups. Site settings
  and Product settings allow your Site Managers and Commerce Managers to append a new
  Contact Group to a Contact whenever they place an Order.</p>
