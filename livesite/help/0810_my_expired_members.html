  <h1>My Expired Members</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Contacts that have a Member ID and a past-dated Expiration
  Date.</p>

  <p>TIP: You can update the Expiration Date field in the Contact to a future date and
  their access to Membership Folder content will be restored instantly.</p>

  <p>NOTE: The existence of a Member ID and future Expiration Date does not necessarily
  mean this Contact can view any Pages or Files in the Membership Folders yet. If the
  Contact is also found on the "Unregistered Members" screen, then they have not
  registered yet, and therefore do not have Membership Folder access.</p>
