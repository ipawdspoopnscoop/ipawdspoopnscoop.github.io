  <h1>My Short Links</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Short Links that you have access to. A Short Link
  allows you to specify an alias for a Page, Product Group, Product, or URL. It is ideal
  for marketers that need to create a short, easy-to-remember link for their
  advertisements. For example, a Short Link named "bigevent" could be added, making it
  possible to advertise a link to a Page in your promotional materials as
  "example.com/bigevent".</p>

  <p>You can also create Short Links for Product Groups and Products so that you can give
  a short address (e.g. example.com/widget) to people which will forward to the item on a
  Catalog or Catalog Detail Page.</p>

  <p>You can setup multiple Short Links for the same Page, Product Group, or Product.
  This allows you to setup a new Short Link for an item and not break previous Short
  Links.</p>

  <p>For each Short Link you have the option of adding a tracking code so that the system
  will remember that a Visitor came from that Short Link. Tracking codes can then be
  viewed in various areas of the system (e.g. Visitor/Order reports). This allows you to
  setup marketing campaigns and do A/B testing. For example, you could setup two Short
  Links that forward to the same Page, Product Group, or Product (e.g.
  example.com/campaign1 and example.com/campaign2) and then determine which campaign was
  more effective. For Short Links with a URL destination type, if you want to include a
  tracking code, then you will need to include it manually in the destination URL (e.g.
  pages/example?t=example).</p>

  <p>You can also create Short Links that forward to any URL. This allows you to forward
  a Visitor to any URL at your website (e.g. pages/form_item_view?r=123,
  files/example.pdf, or etc.) or to a URL at an external website (e.g.
  http://www.example.com/example.html).</p>

  <p>Users with a Manager, Designer or Administrator role have access to all Short Links.
  For Users with a User role, see access rules below.</p>

  <p>For Short Links with Page, Product Group, or Product destination types:<br />
  You have access to Short Links where you have edit access to the destination Page.</p>

  <p>For Short Links with the URL destination type:<br />
  You have access to all Short Links that you created.</p>

  <p>For Short Links with Page, Product Group, or Product destination types, Short Links
  will not break when the names for Pages, Product Groups, and Products are changed.
  Also, those types of Short Links will be deleted automatically when the corresponding
  Page, Product Group, or Product is deleted. Alternatively, Short Links with the URL
  destination type are not automatically managed in this way. You will have to manage
  them manually.</p>
