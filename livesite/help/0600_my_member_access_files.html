  <h1>My Membership Access Files</h1>

  <p>These Files have been placed in a Membership Folder, which provides you an easy way
  of prompting your site Visitors to register as a member with the website before
  proceeding on the the File they requested.</p>

  <p>Whenever a site Visitor attempts to access a one of these Membership Files, and they
  are not logged in, the Membership Entrance Page will be displayed, and they will be
  given the option to register as a member (requires a valid Member ID), or login before
  continuing on to the Membership File they requested.</p>

  <p>To create a Membership Access File, simply move any File into a Membership
  Folder.</p>
