  <h1>Form View Directory Page Type</h1>

  <p>Form View Directory Page Type displays information about multiple Form List Views on
  one Page. There is an optional summary area which will show the most recent, most
  viewed, and most active Submitted Forms. Below the summary area, is a list of all
  selected Form List Views along with data for each one (i.e. number of Submitted Forms,
  number of Comments, number of views, last updated time). If you have many forums that
  use different Custom Forms and Views, this Page Type can be useful for listing all of
  your forums together on one Page.<br />
  <br />
  Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>
