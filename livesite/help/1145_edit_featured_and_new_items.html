<h1>Edit Featured &amp; New Items</h1>
<p>Featured items are Product Groups and Products that you want to highlight on Catalog Pages. Similarly, new items are new Product Groups and Products that you want to highlight on Catalog Pages.</p>
<p>In order to set featured items, you may enter a sort order number for the Product Groups and Products that you want to feature. Items with a lower featured order will be displayed first. It is recommended that you leave gaps in featured order numbers, in order to be able to easily reorder featured items in the future (e.g. 100, 110, 120).</p>
<p>In order to set new items, you may enter a date (format: m/d/yyyy) for Product Groups and Products that you want to display as new items. Newer items will be displayed first, and older items will be displayed last. New items with dates in the future will not be displayed as new items until the dates are no longer in the future.</p>
<p>As a Customer browses through a catalog, featured and new items from the current product group and all sub-product groups can be shown. For example, if a customer is currently browsing in the top-level product group (e.g. Electronics), then featured and new items in that product group and all sub-product groups (e.g. TV's, Cameras) can be shown. It is important to understand this when entering featured order numbers, because featured orders numbers are compared across the product group hierarchy and not just in a single level of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>The top featured item or newest item, if there are no featured items, is highlighted more strongly on a Catalog Page. This means that more information (e.g. full description) is displayed about that item on a Catalog Page.</p>
<p>After setting featured and new items on this screen, you must enter a "Number of Featured Items" and a "Number of New Items" for the page properties for a Catalog Page, so that the featured and new items are displayed.</p>
<p>TIP: You can use this feature to not only to create a dynamically changing catalog of products, but also to create a dynamically changing catalog of media! To do this, simply create a product for each media item, set it's Price to "0.00", and set it's Selection Type to "Donation". This will surpress the ecommerce features. Additionally, if you want to display the media, and sell a full-length version, you can easily update the Price, and your media items can be purchased online.</p>
