  <h1>My Private Access Pages</h1>

  <p>These Pages have been placed in a Private Folder, which provides you an easy way of
  prompting your site Visitors to &nbsp;login with the website before proceeding on the
  the Page they requested.<br />
  <br />
  Whenever a site Visitor attempts to access a one of these Private Pages, and they are
  not logged in, the Login Page will be displayed, and they will be prompted to login
  before continuing on to the Private Page they requested. &nbsp;If they do not have
  "View" rights to the Private Folder where the Private Page resides, they will be denied
  access and the Error Page will be displayed with that message.</p>

  <p>To create a Private Access Page, simply move any Page into a Private Folder.</p>
