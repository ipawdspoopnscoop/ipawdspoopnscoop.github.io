  <h1>Import Contacts</h1>

  <p>You can Import Contacts into your website database from your local computer any
  Comma Separated Values (CSV) File. CSV file format is a universally accepted way to
  move data between systems. Most spreadsheet programs and databases can save data as a
  CSV text file so it is an ideal way to upload Contacts.</p>

        computer that contains the Contacts that you wish to import.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: You do not need to import all the available columns.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>
          <h3>Import Options</h3>

      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Import Mode:</td>

        <td>Import all Contacts: This mode imports all Contacts found in the CSV file,
        regardless of whether they already exist. If the Contact already exists
        (determined by a matching e-mail address), the opt-in and out-out values are
        copied (preserved) from the existing Contact to the new Contact.<br />
        Only import Contacts with unique e-mail addresses: This mode imports ONLY the
        Contacts from the CSV file that contain e-mail addresses not shared by any
        existing Contact. This mode allows you to incrementally quot;overlay" new
        Contacts into the system without affecting any existing Contacts.</td>

  <h2>Importing from Microsoft Outlook</h2>

  <p>You can easily import your Address Book from MS Outlook and create mailing lists for
  your important Contacts.</p>

  <h2>Importing from a Member Database</h2>

  <p>When importing Members, please include all Member IDs in the Member_id column.<br />
  <br />
  A Member ID should be a string of characters that your the Member will know, because
  they will need to use them to register as Members after you have imported the
  unregistered Members.<br />
  <br />
  Also, you may want to also include Expiration Dates in the expiration_date column.  Please be aware that the format of the expiration date should be yyyy-mm-dd.</p>

  <p>After the Members have been imported, you should direct your unregistered Members to
  any Page on your website that is placed in a Membership Access Folder. &nbsp;When they
  reach this Page,&nbsp;the system will prompt them to register as a Member by displaying
  the Membership Entrance Page. They will need to know their Member ID to go beyond this
  Page. &nbsp;This step provide your members with secure login accounts for their
  protection.</p>

  <p>Once the&nbsp;Member has successfully registered,&nbsp;the system will redirect them
  to the original Page in the Membership Access Folder you directed them too.</p>

  <h2>Importing&nbsp;Affiliates</h2>

  <p>You can import Affiliates and their Affiliate Codes, and Commission Rates using the
  Contacts Import feature.</p>

  <h2>Import from CSV file</h2>

  <p>The easiest way is to get your data into columns in a spreadsheet. You may import
  Contacts by uploading a CSV file. You can save a CSV file from Microsoft Excel. Here
  are the guidelines for the CSV file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The first row of the CSV file must contain the names of the columns that you wish
    to import data for.</li>

    <li>You may use any number of columns from the list below.</li>

    <li>Columns can be listed in any order.</li>

    <li>Column names must be similar to those in the list below (i.e. "first_name" or
    "First Name" or "FirstName" or "firstname" or etc.).</li>

    <li>Exported column names from Outlook are supported.</li>

    <li>The possible values for opt_in are "0" (Opt-Out) and "1" (Opt-In). "1" is the
    default.</li>

    <li>The possible values for affiliate_approved are "0" (not approved) and "1"
    (approved). "0" is the default.</li>

    <li>If you are saving a CSV file on a Mac, you might need to select the "Windows CSV"
    format in Excel.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is the list of the valid Contact Properties that you can import. Place one of
  the following on the first row of each of your data columns:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>email_address</li>

    <li>opt_out</li>

    <li>salutation</li>
