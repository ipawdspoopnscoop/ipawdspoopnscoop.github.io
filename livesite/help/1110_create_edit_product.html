          Product. Enabled Products will appear on Order Form, Catalog, and Catalog
          Detail Pages and be available to Customers for ordering, while disabled
          Products will not. In addition, if a Product is disabled after a Customer has
          added it to his/her cart, then the Product will be automatically removed from
          the cart, before the Customer is allowed to submit the Order. Also, when a cart
          is retrieved or a completed Order is re-ordered, then disabled Products are
          automatically removed from the new cart.</p>

          <p>When a Product is disabled, its relationship with various Product Groups is
          maintained, so if you need to re-enable the Product in the future, you can
          quickly do so and have it automatically appear in all of the same Product
          Groups as before.</p>

          <p>If you are needing to disable a Product because of inventory issues, then
          you might want to use the Track Inventory feature on this screen instead,
          because it allows you to display an out-of-stock message to Customers.</p>

          <p>Tag clouds will automatically be updated when you enabled/disable
          Products.</p>
