  TIP: Order Reports are shared among all Commerce Managers, so you can setup reports for
  others to run and view. &nbsp;However, you should also take care when editing someone
  else's report.</p>

  <p>NOTE: When you add a Filter, it is not saved to the report until you click "Save
  &amp; Run".</p>

  <p>NOTE: Deleting a Order Report does not delete any of the Order data.</p>
