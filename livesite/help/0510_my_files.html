  <h1>All My Files</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Files that you have access to, except archived Files
  (see All My Archived Files).</p>

  <h2>Viewing &amp; Editing Files</h2>

  <p>You can view and edit any File you have access to by selecting the File from any of
  the Files screens, which are grouped by File Type. &nbsp;Some of the File's properties
  are also visible.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Design Files are displayed in a light gray color. If you are a Site Designer,
  then you can click on the filename as a shortcut to access the Design File directly
  from this screen.</p>

  <h2>Searching Files</h2>

  <p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for any File by
  it's properties. (File content is excluded from the search).</p>

  <h2>Modifying Files</h2>

  <p>You can modify the Folder and design property, if you are a Site Designer, for one
  or more Files by selecting the Files you wish to modify and clicking "Modify Selected".
  Since access control is handled by the File's Folder, modifying the File allows you to
  easily protect a File.</p>

  <p>WARNING: Since changing a File's Folder affects its access control, you can
  accidentally make a Private File accessible or a Public File inaccessible to others
  attempting to view the File. Keep this in mind when moving Files among Folders.</p>

  <h2>Creating Files</h2>

  <p>To create a File, click on "Upload Files".</p>

  <h2>Deleting Files</h2>

  <p>To delete a File from the web server, select the File you wish to delete and click
  "Delete Selected".</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you delete a File, any links or references to the File will need to be
  updated.</p>

  <p>WARNING: Take care when deleting Files, there is no undo.</p>
