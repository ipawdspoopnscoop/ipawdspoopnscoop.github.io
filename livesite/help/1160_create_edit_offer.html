        the best Offer from the group. Alternatively, if "Only Apply Best Offer" is not
        checked then all of the Offers will be applied. The former allows you to setup
        offers where only one offer will be given based on order levels (e.g.
        increasingly better free product at higher order levels). The latter allows
        multiple Offers to be applied when a customer enters a single Offer code. It is
        important that all Offers in a group have the same setting for "Only Apply Best
        Offer".</td>
