  <h1>All States</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all States.</p>

  <p>States provide two geographical functions for the website.</p>

  <p>First, they are used to define Shipping Zones, Product Shipping Zones,&nbsp;and Tax
  Zones.</p>

  <p>Secondly, they are used to create the address entry fields that your Customer will
  use to enter their billing address and each recipient's shipping addresses.</p>

  <p>The Billing Address is entered by the Customer</p>

  <ul>
    <li>during checkout on the Billing Information Page, or the Express Order Page, or
    the Order Preview Page.</li>

    <li>after they login and view their My Account information, and update their billing
    address on the Account Profile Page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Shipping Address is entered by the Customer</p>

  <ul>
    <li>during checkout on the Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Page.</li>

    <li>after they login and view their My Account information, and update their shipping
    addresses on the Update Address Book Page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>NOTE: The Country selected by the Customer affects the State selection list for the
  Customer. The website system uses this method to unclutter the State selections
  available to the Customer by displaying only the State choices within Country selected
  by the Customer.</p>

  <p>IMPORTANT: If a Country does not have any States defined for it, the website will
  display a blank text area for the Customer to enter the State value themselves. This
  value will be saved and exported with the Order data.</p>
