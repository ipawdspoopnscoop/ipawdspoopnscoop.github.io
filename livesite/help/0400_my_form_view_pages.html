  <h1>My Form View Pages</h1>

  <p>Form View Pages are ideal for creating directory pages, event registration
  lists,&nbsp;media archive pages, and just about any other view that you can dream
  up.</p>

  <p>Custom Form View Page Types work with submitted data that is collected from Custom
  Form Pages.&nbsp; Form View Pages allow you to filter and display submitted data in
  many different ways.&nbsp;All this without requiring any custom database
  programming.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>TIP:&nbsp;Form List Views and Form Item Views have fully customizable data layouts,
  so you can limit the data that is displayed. Also, by&nbsp; securing these Pages into
  Folders, you can also limit who can see the data displayed.</p>

  <h2>Form List View Page</h2>

  <p>Form List View Page Type displays one or more rows of submitted data collected from
  a single Custom Form.&nbsp; You can define the layout of the data, any filters, and the
  sort order of the displayed data.&nbsp; This Page Type would be used as a listing, or
  directory page, for example.</p>

  <h2>Form Item View Page</h2>

  <p>Form Item View Page Type displays a single row of data collected from a single
  Submitted Form. You can define a layout for the fields you want to display. Not all
  data collected on a form must be visible, you can decide which item's are visible and
  even mask or hide some fields.</p>

  <h2>Form View Directory Page</h2>

  <p>Form View Directory Page Type displays information about multiple Form List Views on
  one Page. There is an optional summary area which will show the most recent, most
  viewed, and most active Submitted Forms. Below the summary area, is a list of all
  selected Form List Views along with data for each one (i.e. number of Submitted Forms,
  number of Comments, number of views, last updated time).</p>

  <p>TIP: If you have many forums or blogs on your site, the Form View Directory Page
  Type is useful for listing them all together on one Page.</p>

  <p>To create any of these Page Types, click on "Create Page" or view an existing Page
  and click "Duplicate Page".</p>
