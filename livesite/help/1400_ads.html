  <h1>All Ads</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Ads for the website.</p>

  <p>Ads are common regions&nbsp;of shared content that can be rotated within&nbsp;one or
  more Pages.</p>

  <p>You can add as many Ads to an Ad Region as you desire, and Ads can be displayed in
  any order.</p>

  <p>Ads are displayed when assigned to an&nbsp;Ad Region. Ad Regions&nbsp;define the
  Ads' allowed content area (size), behavior,&nbsp;and location, on one or more
  Pages.</p>

  <h2>Creating &amp; Editing&nbsp;Ads</h2>

  <p>To create a new Ad, click "Create Ad". At least one Ad Region must exist before
  any&nbsp;Ads can be created.</p>

  <p>To edit an existing Ad, click on the name of the Ad.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Users who have edit access to an Ad Region, Site Managers, Site Designers, and
  Site Administrators can create, edit, and delete Ads.</p>

  <h2>Displaying&nbsp;Ads</h2>

  <p>In order to display&nbsp;an Ad on a Page, the Ad&nbsp;must first be assigned to
  an&nbsp;Ad Region that appears on the Page. Ad Regions are created&nbsp;by Site
  Designers and referenced in Page Styles.</p>

  <p>If a dynamic Ad Region contains more than one Ad, then previous &amp; next buttons
  can appear which allow Visitors to browse through the Ads. Site Designers can
  enable/disable and position these buttons via the Theme Designer for System Themes or
  enable/disable, position, and style these buttons in the CSS for Custom Themes.</p>
