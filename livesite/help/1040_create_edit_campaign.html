  <h1>Create / Edit Campaign</h1>

  <p>This screen allows you to create a new Manual Campaign or update the status of any
  Campaign. Options will be visible and/or editable based on whether this is a Manual or Auto Campaign.</p>

        <td>Once your Campaign is created, you will see a Status field. &nbsp;You can
        edit the status of your Campaign as long as it's not Complete. The Status is
        affected by whether or not the Campaign Scheduler is enabled.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ready to Send</span> means that the Campaign is
        either in the process of being sent, waiting for the Scheduled Time and Date. You
        can start the Campaign at any time by pressing "Send Campaign".<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paused</span> means that the Campaign has been
        interrupted by a Campaign Manager. You can restart a paused Campaign at any time
        and the system will pick up where it left off by changing the status to "Ready to
        Send". Scheduled Campaigns restart immediately if they are past due, or set to
        send immediately. If the Campaign Scheduler is not enabled, click on Send
        Campaign" to restart the Campaign immediately.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancelled</span>&nbsp;means that the Campaign
        has been stopped by a Campaign Manager. You cannot restart a Campaign that has
        been cancelled. If the Campaign has already started sending e-mails,&nbsp;those
        e-mails will still be delivered.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Completed</span> means that all e-mail messages
        have been sent for the Campaign. You cannot change the Status or restart a
        Campaign after it has been completed.</td>

        <br />
        TIP: You should not select a complex Page to send, like one with a shared
        multi-level Menu, or Custom Form Page. Rendering them in an e-mail message might
        break some of their functionality. Typically, your Site Designer will add a Page
        Style specifically designed for any Pages that are going to be e-mailed.</td>

          </table><br />
          NOTE: The number listed next to each Contact Group is not the total number of
          Contacts in the group, but rather the number of Contacts with a valid e-mail
          addresses.<br />
          <br />
          IMPORTANT: Only those Subscribers that have already "opted-in" the Included
          Contact Groups BEFORE the Campaign was created will be included.

          <p>For unix web servers (i.e. not Windows), if name info can be found for the
          recipient's Contact, then the name will be included in the "To:" field of the
          e-mail, along with the e-mail address (e.g. Andrew Smith
          &lt;example@example.com&gt;). The format of the name is the same format that is
          used for the ^^name^^ mail merge field. In summary, if the Contact has a
          nickname, then the nickname is used, otherwise a combination of the salutation,
          first name, last name, and suffix is used, depending on what values exist. If
          no Contact or name info can be found, or this is a Windows server, then the
          "To:" field will only contain the e-mail address.</p>

        regardless of whether they are in any of the groups listed above.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: If a matching Contact is not found for this&nbsp;e-mail address, the system
        will create a Contact for the new Subscriber after sending the e-mail message.
        &nbsp;This will allow them to "opt-out" if necessary.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: You can use this feature to send yourself or someone else a "proof" of the
        e-mail Campaign before you send it to your Subscribers.</td>

  <p><br />
  NOTE: E-mail messages are sent individually, so it may take some time for the entire
  Campaign to be delivered.</p>

  <p>NOTE: For HTML Campaigns, when a Campaign is created a unique tracking code will
  automatically be added to the end of each returning link (this is a link that comes
  back to your site) that does not already contain a tracking code.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Because the majority of e-mail clients do not support JavaScript, E-mail
  Campaigns will not include it. This means Pages that contain Ad Regions, Photo
  Galleries, or any other type of JavaScript should not be e-mailed.</p>
