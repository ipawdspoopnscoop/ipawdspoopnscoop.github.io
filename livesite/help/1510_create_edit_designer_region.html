  <p>TIP: The Code Editor colorizes your code and adds line numbers to make it easier to
  read and debug. The Code Editor may take a while to "read" through your code and
  colorize it. This process is particularly slow on Internet Explorer browsers. We
  recommend the Firefox browser for faster editing throughout the website. It is free to
  download, and works on most desktop computers.</p>

  <h2>The Path Tag</h2>

  <p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag can be inserted anywhere
  in your HTML and is replaced automatically with the absolute URL to the location where
  your system software was installed. You should always use the <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag if you need to reference any uploaded files
  within your HTML. This makes your links portable, so if you ever need to move the
  software system to another directory within your web server, your hand-coded links will
  still work.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Let's look at a typical example.</strong></p>

  <p>Say you want to link to a background image file (example.png) that you uploaded
  through the Design Files within the Control Panel. However, you want to be sure that
  the link is portable because your web server administrator originally installed the
  system software into a temporary directory that looked something like this:
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">http://192.168.0.1/~example/software</span> and
  will need to move the system software to <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">http://www.example.com/software</span> once you have setup
  your domain and are ready to launch the site.</p>

  <p>So if you hard-code your link to example.png file like this:<br />
  <br />
  <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">http://192.168.0.1/~example/software/files/example.png</span>
  or<br />
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">/files/example.png</span><br />
  <br />
  Then when the system software is moved later to another directory, this link would no
  longer work. So instead, be sure to link to the file using the <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag:<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}files/example.png</span></p>

  <p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag is only necessary within
  your custom HTML such as Custom Page Styles, Editable Head Content in System Page
  Styles, Designer Regions, and within custom CSS files. The <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag is not necessary when adding links through
  the Rich-text Editor. These links will be converted automatically for you when the
  content region is saved.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you are the web server administrator and move the system to another
  directory off of your webroot after installation, be sure to update your .htaccess file
  per the system's installation / update instructions.</p>
