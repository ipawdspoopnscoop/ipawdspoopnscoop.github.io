<h1>All Recurring Commission Profiles</h1>

<p>This screen displays all Recurring Commission Profiles that are created by the system when a commission is detected for a recurring Product that is ordered. Each recurring Product (and Quantity) will have it's own Recurring Commission Profile.</p>

<p>When an order is placed, the system will create and enable the Recurring Commission Profiles needed.  Each day, the recurring profiles are scanned, and if a new commission is due, then a new commission will be added to the All Commissions screen and set to the status of "Pending". If you want to "pause" or "stop" or "restart" the creation of new commissions, you can disable or enable the Recurring Commission Profiles at any time. Doing so will not retroactively create any commissions that where missed, the system only looks forward.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Take care in disabling Recurring Commission Profiles, since you cannot create or recreate commissions manually.</p>
