        The Member ID can be set manually when you create a new Contact by clicking on
        "Create Contact", or when you "Import Contacts". These methods produce
        unregistered Members. They will still need to register themselves (complete the
        Membership Entrance Page) before they can login and get Membership Access.<br />
        <br />
        The Member ID can also be set automatically whenever a Registered User orders a
        Product (Add Days to Membership property). The Member ID is set to the Order's
        unique Reference Code. The Member ID can be changed from it's default value to
        anything else at any time. The user will have Membership Folder access
        immediately.<br />

        The Member ID can also be set automatically whenever a Registered User submits a
        Custom Form (Grant Membership Trial property). The Member ID is set to the
        Submitted Form's unique Reference Code. The Member ID can be changed from it's
        default value to anything else at any time. The user will have Membership Folder
        access immediately.<br />

        NOTE: If the User's Contact does not have a Member ID at any time (it is blank)
        they will not be able to view any Membership Folders. ANY value in the Member ID
        field is considered a Member and will have Membership Folder access (unless their
        Expiration Date has expired).</td>

        expired and the User will not be able to access any Membership Folder
        content.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: If the Member orders more days, or completes another trial custom form, the
        Expiration Date is brought to the current date first, then the "days" specified
        are applied. Using the Membership renewal notification feature in the Site

        Contact Groups serve two purposes for the Contact. One purpose is to organize, or

        the Contact Group and you can "opt-in" or "opt-out" the Contact from the Contact
        Group's subscription (mailing list).<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This setting is overridden by the Contact's global "Opt-in" setting

        <br />
        NOTE: It is not possible for a Subscriber to opt themselves into a "Closed"
        subscription Contact Group. Therefore, if you want the Contact to be included in
        any Campaigns for any Closed subscriptions, you will need to manually add them
        ("opt-in") using this screen.</td>
