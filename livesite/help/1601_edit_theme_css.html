<h1>Edit CSS</h1>

<p>This screen allows you to edit your own CSS files directly on the server, and replaces the tedious task of downloading, making changes, and re-uploading design files again and again during the site design process. It is also a great way to make quick edits to your Custom Theme and previewing the results before activating your newly modified Theme.</p>

<p>NOTE: You cannot edit a System Theme's CSS file directly so the system will only let you edit the CSS file if it is not a System Theme.</p>

<h2>Code Editor</h2>

<p>The Code Editor colorizes your code and adds line numbers to make it easier to read and debug. The Code Editor may take a while to "read" through your code and colorize it.  This process is particularly slow on Internet Explorer browsers. We recommend the Firefox browser for faster editing throughout the website. It is free to download, and works on most desktop computers.</p>

<h2>Saving Your Changes</h2>

<p>There are two ways to save your changes when editing.  "Save" will save your edits into the same CSS file that you are editing, as you would expect.</p>

<p>"Save A New Copy" will save your edits into a new CSS file, thus preserving your original CSS file unaltered. After the new file is created, you will be editing the new copy. You can use this method to create new versions of your CSS file so that you can back up to any version that you desire.</p>

<h2>Previewing Your Changes</h2>
<p>"Preview" allows you to preview your CSS edits in the Preview Theme Window.</p>

<p>NOTE: While previewing a Theme's CSS, if you click on a link that is on the Page that you are previewing then it will take you out of the preview mode.  Also, Preview will launch a new window, so you need to make sure your browser is configured to allow for Pop Up Windows from your website.  With some browser versions, the CSS changes do not seem to show up.  If that happens, your browser is simply using a previous version of the CSS file it has in memory, so you will need to clear the browser's cache (press Ctrl-F5 in Windows, or Command-R on the Mac).</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Using "Preview" does not save the changes you have made to the CSS file, so be sure to "Save" your changes before leaving the Code Editor. If you don't wish to save your changes, you can always "Cancel".</p>
