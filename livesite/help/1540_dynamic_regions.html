<h1>All Dynamic Regions</h1>

<p>Dynamic Regions are shared programming code areas that you can create for only
your Site Designers to maintain directly from a Page.</p>

<p>For security and reliability reasons, only Dynamic Regions are allowed to contain PHP code.</p>

<p>Since Dynamic Regions are placed into Page Styles, they become shared content
that can be displayed on one, some, or all of your website Pages.</p>

<p>TIP: Dynamic Regions are ideal for integrating your website with other applications or databases.</p>

<p>Unlike Page Regions, Dynamic Regions must be create manually by a Site Designer before they can be edited.</p>

<h2>Searching Dynamic Regions</h2>

<p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for
any Dynamic Region by it's properties and content.</p>
