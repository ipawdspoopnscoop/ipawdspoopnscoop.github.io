  <h1>Shopping Cart Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Shopping Cart Page totals all Product items for the current Customer and applies
  any discounts or Offers to the Order subtotal. The Customer can update quantities and
  remove items from their cart, enter and apply Offers, add any qualifying Up-Sell Offers
  to their cart, bookmark the Saved Cart link, or start the secure Checkout process.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td></td>

        <td></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Update Button Label:</td>

        <td>Enter the text you wish to display on the "Update" button. This button will
        recalculate the total, apply Offers if any and display the results.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Shopping Cart Label:</td>

        <td>This label allows you to customize the system messages that are displayed for
        this Page.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: You only need to place one or two words here. For example, if you are
        creating a retail storefront, you might want this label to be "Gift Bag". Then
        whenever an empty shopping cart is displayed,&nbsp;the message "Your Gift Bag is
        Empty." would be displayed to the Customer.</td>
