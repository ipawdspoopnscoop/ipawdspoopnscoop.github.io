<h1>All Verified Shipping Addresses</h1><p></p>

<p>This screen displays all the optional verified shipping addresses you may like to present to your Shoppers when they checkout.</p>

<p>Verified Shipping Addresses are ideal if your website commonly ships gifts to camps, or organizations where the exact shipping address may be unknown to the Shopper, or when shipments are common sent to organizations that have a preferred physical address where shipments are received.</p>

<p>When a Shopper reaches the Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Page, if ANY Verified Shipping Addresses are defined, then the shopper will be presented with the option to use one of these Verified Shipping Addresses to pre-fill their shipping address fields. (So if you want to remove the verified shipping address area from your Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Pages, please delete all the Verified Shipping Addresses found under the [Commerce] tab.</p>

<h2>Creating Verified Shipping Addresses</h2>

<p>You can create and assign Verified Shipping Addresses to any State/Province in any Country you have already defined within the "All Countries" and "All States" screens in the Commerce area of the Control Panel.</p>

<p>The Country selected as the default country (see "All Countries") will be selected when the Verified Shipping Address fields appear on the Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Page.

<h2>Editing Verified Shipping Addresses</h2>

<p>Click on the Verified Shipping Address to edit or delete it.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you don't want to display any Verified Shipping Addresses on your Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Pages, then you need to delete all Verified Shipping Addresses.</p>
