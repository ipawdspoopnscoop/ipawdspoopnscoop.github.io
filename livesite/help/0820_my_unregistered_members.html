  <h1>My Unregistered Members</h1>

  <p>This screen displays Contacts that contain a Member ID, but do not have a
  corresponding User account associated with them. Therefore, these Contacts do not
  have access to Membership Folders yet.</p>

  <p>Members still must register either through:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>the Membership Entrance Page</li>

    <li>the Registration Entrance Page and purchase a membership Product</li>

    <li>the Registration Entrance Page and submit a membership trial Custom Form</li>
  </ol>

  <p>in order to create a User account that will allow them access until the Expiration
  Date passes.</p>
