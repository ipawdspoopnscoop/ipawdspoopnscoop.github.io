  <h1>Editing Page Content</h1>

  <p>A "Page" is a web page on your website that can be viewed or edited. Pages are
  constructed "on-the-fly" in real-time when requested from a website Visitor, and are
  made up of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Content.</span> Page's contain "Page
    Regions" that hold text and images, just like word processor document. Page Regions
    exist on only the one&nbsp;Page, and are not shared by other Pages.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interaction.</span> Each Page can also provide a
    website function, like a login page, a custom form page to gather data,&nbsp;a
    catalog&nbsp;page to display products, or one of dozens of other interactive "Page
    Types"&nbsp;built right into the system. These Pages of various Page Types are then
    linked together to build custom work flow into your website.</li>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Design &amp; Shared Content. <span style=
    "font-weight: normal;">Each Page's content and interaction is then wrapped in an HTML
    design, called a "Page Style". &nbsp;A Page can define it's own Page Style, or share
    the Page Style with other Pages in the same Folder. Page Styles also define a Page's
    shared content, like site-wide menus, or sidebars that appear only on a certain
    section of the website. &nbsp;These shared content areas include "Common Regions",
    "Ad Regions", and "Menu Regions".</span></li>

    <li style="font-weight: bold;">Page Comments. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Each
    Page can also contain Comments. Comments contain an author and textual content which
    is attached to the Page and exist as long as they are not deleted and the Page still
    exists. Comments are not duplicated when a Page is duplicated. Anyone with edit
    rights to the Page's Folder can edit, delete, or publish the Comments (Moderator).
    For true authorship verification, the User name of the Contributor will be revealed
    to the Page Moderator, if known, regardless of what is entered in the author
    field.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Edit Mode &amp; View Modes</h2>

  <p>The system has a built-in process for create and editing content that is seamlessly
  integrated into every Page. &nbsp;While you remain logged in, you can browse
  &nbsp;through the site, Page by Page, stopping to edit content, link to content, upload
  photos and videos, and continue on building and updating your website, using only your
  web browser.</p>

  <p><strong>If you click the "grid" button on the top right corner of a Page, any
  editable region found on the Page (you have access too) will be outlined with dashed
  lines and a corresponding colored "Edit" button will appear.</strong></p>

  <p>In Edit Mode, you can click on any "Edit" button and edit the content:</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Regions</span>: If you are a Content Manager,
  you can click on the blue "Edit" buttons to edit any Page Region content using the
  built-in Rich-text Editor. If the Page's Page Type has interactive properties, such as
  a Custom Form, these properties can also be edited through the blue "Edit" buttons.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Page Comments</span>: If you are a Content Manager,
  you can click on the blue "Edit" buttons to edit or publish any Comments posted to the
  Page.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">System Regions</span>: If the Page's Page Type is
  not "Standard", it will possess interactive properties, you can click on the colored
  "Edit" button to access the specific page type properties:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Black "Edit" buttons indicate a System Region's header and footer. These header
      and footer areas are shared among all Page that includes this System Region in
      their Page Styles.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Purple "Edit" buttons indicate that the content or feature is custom form
      related. These areas are linked to the either the custom form or form list / item
      view that is embedded within the Page.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Green "Edit" buttons indicate that the content or feature is e-commerce related
      and are linked to the e-commerce Products and Product Groups so you can edit them
      directly from any Page they are being displayed on.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Orange "Edit" buttons indicate that the content or feature is a calendar related
      and are linked to the calendars so you can edit them directly from any Page they
      are being displayed on.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Common Regions &amp; Menus</span>: If you are a
  Site Manager, then you can click on the red "Edit" buttons to update any Menus and
  Common Regions using the built-in Rich-text Editor.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Designer Regions</span>: If you are a Site
  Designer, you can click on the red "Edit" button to update to code within any Designer
  Region.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product Group</span> &amp; <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">Products:</span> If you are a Commerce Manager, then you can click
  on the green "Edit" buttons on any relevant Commerce Pages to edit the Products and
  Product Groups directly from the Page.</p>

  <h2>Image Editing with PicMonkey</h2>

  <p>PicMonkey is a free photo editing service that will allow you to re-size, crop,
  colorize and clean up your website photos without leaving your websites. To use
  PicMonkey, be sure you are in Edit Mode, and simply hover over any image in a content
  area, and click on the "PicMonkey" button that appears over the image. The image must
  be a GIF, JPEG, or PNG, and you must have edit rights to the image's Folder in order to
  edit it.</p>

  <p>PicMonkey is a Flash application, so be sure you have the proper Flash plug-in
  installed for your browser. After the PicMonkey application loads, and a copy of your
  image is sent to the PicMonkey server, you can begin editing your image. If you decide
  not to keep your changes, you can click the "X" (close), which will cancel your changes
  and return you to your web page. If you decide to keep your changes, then click "Save",
  and you will be prompted to either "Replace" the original image on your website, or
  "Save a Copy" of the image, which will preserve the original image and create a new
  image and update your web page with the new image name. Be sure not to navigate away
  from the PicMonkey application screen before you save your changes, or they may be
  lost.</p>

  <p>If you save a GIF in PicMonkey then a new PNG copy will be created and your web page
  will be updated to use the new PNG. This is necessary because PicMonkey does not
  currently support saving as a GIF format. Your original GIF image will remain in the
  system. Therefore, the system will always "Save a Copy" for GIF's regardless of whether
  you select "Replace" or "Save a Copy".</p>

  <p>NOTE: Images that appear in the system content for Form Item View and Form List View
  Pages can only be replaced. A new copy of these images cannot be saved from PicMonkey.
  Also, the width and height for the image tag will not be updated. Also, GIF images in
  Form Item View and Form List View Pages may not be edited with PicMonkey.</p>

  <p>DISCLAIMER: Be aware that the basic PicMonkey services are free but their terms are
  subject to change at any time. We cannot warrant their service, features, advertising,
  or availability. This service is provided to you AS-IS. Also, when using PicMonkey, a
  copy of your image is transmitted across the Internet to the PicMonkey server. We
  cannot encrypt nor maintain Folder security for any image once it has left the website,
  so please keep this in mind if you are ever editing images that may contain sensitive
  information.</p>

  <h2>Full Screen Mode</h2>

  <p>If you click the "up arrow" button on the top right corner of your Page, the menu
  will roll up and disappear, allowing you to see your web page exactly as it would
  appear to site Visitors. &nbsp;Clicking the button again will pull-down the menu again,
  so you can access other features.<br />
  <br />
  Full Screen Mode works in both Edit and View Modes.</p>

  <h2>Edit Page Style</h2>

  <p>If you are a Site Designer, you can click on this button to edit the Page's Page
  Style, in order to update the layout of the Page and add/remove Regions.</p>

  <h2>Theme Preview Mode</h2>

  <p>If you are a Site Manager or a Site Designer, you can click on the "Theme Preview"
  link, to browse your website using any CSS theme that has been programmed into your
  website. &nbsp;Theme Preview does not affect any other website Visitor, the previewed
  Theme is only visible to your computer. &nbsp;Click "Cancel" to cancel Theme preview
  Mode. The Theme that you preview will also be used by the rich-text editor to determine
  custom formats and styling.</p>

  <h2>Edit Page Properties</h2>

  <p>Click this button to access the Page's properties.</p>

  <h2>Duplicate Page</h2>

  <p>To create a new Page, it is faster to duplicate an existing Page. &nbsp;Click this
  button to make a copy of the current Page. Duplicating a Page also duplicates it's
  properties, and page content. &nbsp;A new name is given to the duplicated Page and you
  will be directed to the new page. Page Comments are not duplicated.</p>

  <h2>Create Campaign</h2>

  <p>Click this button to create an E-mail Campaign using the Page. &nbsp;You must be a
  Campaign Manager to use this feature.</p>

  <h2>Creating an Approval Process for Page Updates</h2>

  <p>Since all Page edits are updated on the website in real-time, there are many times
  that you wish to make changes and preview them before making them "live" for all to
  see.&nbsp; In order to do this, we recommend that you follow this process:</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <ol>
      <li>Duplicate the original Page. The system will instantly create a new copy of the
      Page with a unique Page name, and redirect you to the new Page.</li>

      <li>Make changes to the duplicate Page and save and view.&nbsp; Since the new Page
      is not linked into any of the site menus, then the Page will not be found by any
      visitor unexpectedly. For added security, you may wish to move the duplicated Page
      into a Private Folder during the approval process.</li>

      <li>If the Page need to be approved by someone else, send them a link to the
      page.&nbsp; (Be sure they have "read" or "edit" access to the Folder where the
      duplicated Page is located.)</li>

      <li>Once the duplicate Page is updated and approved and you are ready to make the
      Page "live", rename the original Page to a new name, and quickly rename the
      duplicated Page to the original Page's name. Also, be sure the duplicated Page is
      in the same Folder as the original Page was in so that it can be accessed by the
      same audience.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <ol>
    <li>If the original Page was linked to any of your Menu Regions, edit the Menus and
    change the link to point to the new Page (which will have the original page name at
    this point). That's it. You're done!</li>
  </ol>
