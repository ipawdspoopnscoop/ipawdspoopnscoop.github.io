<h1>Edit JavaScript</h1>

<p>This screen allows you to edit your JavaScript files directly on the server, so you don't have to download them, make your changes, and re-upload them again during site design. This is a great way to make quick edits to your website's JavaScript files.</p>

<h2>Code Editor</h2>

<p>The Code Editor colorizes your code and adds line numbers to make it easier to read and debug. The Code Editor may take a while to "read" through your code and colorize it.  This process is particularly slow on Internet Explorer browsers. We recommend the Firefox browser for faster editing throughout the website. It is free to download, and works on most desktop computers.</p>

<h2>Saving Your Changes</h2>

<p>There are two ways to save your changes when editing.  "Save" will save your edits into the same JavaScript file that you are editing, as you would expect.</p>

<p>"Save A New Copy" will save your edits into a new JavaScript file, thus preserving your original JavaScript file unaltered. After the new file is created, you will be editing the new copy. You can use this method to create new versions of your JavaScript file so that you can back up to any version that you desire.</p>

<p>NOTE: When you load your site to test your updates you will need to make sure to press CTRL-F5 (Command-R on Mac) to tell your browser to re-download the JavaScript file.</p>
