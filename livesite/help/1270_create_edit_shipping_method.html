  NOTE: The Transit-related fields above are only required if you are using the Arrival
  Date feature. &nbsp;In that case, these values are compared against the Requested
  Arrival Date selected by the Customer to determine if this Shipping Method should be
  displayed to the Customer.</p>

  <p>TIP: If you only create one Shipping Method, the Customer will not be prompted to
  select a Shipping Methods. &nbsp;However, if only one Shipping Method is available that
  matches the Product to the Destination, the Customer will still be prompted to select
  the only option they have.</p>

  <p>TIP: You may need to divide up your Shipping Methods into new, smaller Shipping
  Methods to accommodate more complex shipping fee structures.</p>
