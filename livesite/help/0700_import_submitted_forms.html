  <h1>Import Submitted Forms</h1>

  <p>You can Import Submitted Form data from your local computer using a simple
  spreadsheet file.</p>

  <p>The CSV text file format is a universally accepted way to move data between systems,
  and since most spreadsheet and database programs can import/export CSV text
  files,&nbsp;it is an ideal way to exchange data.</p>

  <table class="field" style="width: 100%;">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>
          <h3>Select Formatted Text File to Upload</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>CSV File:</td>

        <td>Browse and select the CSV file from your local computer that contains the
        Submitted Form data you wish to import.<br />
        <br />
        If you are creating a CSV file from a spreadsheet file, each column in the FIRST
        row of the spreadsheet must match a Field Name from the Custom Form. &nbsp;Once a
        field match is found, the same column for all additional rows will be imported
        into the database for that Field. &nbsp;This matching of fields continues for all
        columns in the first row. When complete, a new Submitted Form that will be
        created for each additional row of data found.<br />
        <br />
        If you are importing data for a field that can contain multiple answers (i.e.
        pick list with multiple selection or check box), you can include multiple answers
        by separating them with a comma (e.g. Apple, Banana, Pear).<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: The columns can be in any order. If you are saving a CSV file on a Mac, you
        might need to select the "Windows CSV" format in Excel.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>
          <h3>Select the Custom Form</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Custom Form:</td>

        <td>Select the Custom Form that contains the Form Definition (fields) that will
        be imported.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>File Upload Fields</h2>

  <p>If the Custom Form has a file upload field, then you might want to connect the
  Submitted Forms to Files. First, upload all of the necessary files via the Files tab.
  You may upload a ZIP file in order to upload many files at once. Next, enter the file
  name, for each file that has already been uploaded, in the file upload field column in
  the CSV file. When files are uploaded into the system underscores are inserted for
  spaces in the file name, so make sure the file names in the CSV file are correct.</p>

  <p>Please be aware that a Submitted Form may not be connected to a Design File or a
  File that is already an Attachment. Also, you must have edit access to the File's
  Folder in order to connect it to a Submitted Form.</p>

  <h2>Limitations when importing Submitted Forms</h2>

  <p>There are two methods for collecting Submitted Form data. &nbsp;The most common is
  to capture a Submitted Form each time a Custom Form Page is submitted through the
  website.&nbsp;The other method is to import the Submitted Form data from a file.</p>

  <p>There are some limitations when importing Submitted Forms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If any Form Fields are set to "Connect to Contact",&nbsp;Contacts and User
    accounts are not updated.</li>

    <li>No Custom Form Page work-flow features or auto-responders are triggered.</li>
  </ul>
