  create an e-mail campaign based on a certain action that a Visitor or User performs on
  the website.</p>

        Deselect this option if you wish to suspend creating any new e-mail campaigns for

        <td>An Action is an event on the website that triggers the creation of a new
        e-mail campaign to the recipient. Actions can any of the following events
        completed by a reachable recipient to the website:<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Calendar Event was reserved</strong>: Select this Action if you want an
        e-mail campaign created whenever a Calendar Event reservation is ordered.&nbsp;
        This Action is great for reservations or ticketed events where you want to set
        reminders before and after the Event date.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This option is only selectable by specific Calendar Managers, as well as
        all Site Administrators, Site Designers, and Site Managers.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Custom Form Submitted:&nbsp;</strong> Select this Action if you want an
        e-mail campaign created whenever a specific Custom Form is submitted.&nbsp; This
        Action is great for sending follow up e-mails to a recipient at some point after
        they have submitted information through the website.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This option is only selectable by specific Form Editors, as well as all
        Site Administrators, Site Designers, and Site Managers.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Order Completed:</strong> Select this Action if you want an e-mail
        campaign created whenever any Order is completed (submitted successfully) on the
        website.&nbsp; This Action is great for sending a follow up e-mail to the
        Customer at some time period after the Order.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This option is only selectable by Commerce Managers, as well as all Site
        Administrators, Site Designers, and Site Managers.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Product Ordered:</strong> Select this Action if you want an e-mail
        campaign created whenever you want to send an e-mail campaign to a Customer at
        some point after they have ordered a specific Product.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This option is only selectable by Commerce Managers, as well as all Site
        Administrators, Site Designers, and Site Managers.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Auto Campaign Sent:</strong> Select this Action if you want an e-mail
        campaign created whenever another Auto Campaign is sent successfully.&nbsp; This
        feature allows you to create 'drip campaigns' by daisy chaining Auto Campaigns
        together.&nbsp; For example, let's say you create an Auto Campaign Profile to
        send an informational e-mail campaign that builds on the previous e-mail
        message.&nbsp; You want the initial e-mail to be sent 2 days after a Product is
        ordered from your website.&nbsp; Then let's say you want to send a second
        build-up e-mail 1 week after that and perhaps a third and final grand finale
        e-mail 1 week after that.&nbsp; Using multiple Auto Campaign Profiles you can
        create this drip campaign scenario, with each campaign only being created if the
        previous e-mail was sent.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: This option will display only Profiles that the User creating this Profile
        has access too.</td>

          <br />
          TIP: You can personalize your Auto Campaigns using the following 'mail-merge'
          type formatting tags to pull in some of the dynamic information into the text
          of the body or your HTML page:</p>

          <p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">^^name^^</span><br />
          <span style=
          "font-family: courier new,courier;">^^action_date_and_time^^</span><br />
          <span style=
          "font-family: courier new,courier;">^^calendar_event_date_and_time_range^^</span><br />

          <span style=

          <br />
          You can also use the following format to customize the date format for date and
          date &amp; time fields. The format can either be a <a href=
          "http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php" target="_blank">PHP date
          format</a> or "relative" for a relative time (e.g. "2 minutes ago", "2 minutes
          from now").</p>

          <p>Format: ^^value^^%%format%%</p>

          <p>Examples:<br />
          ^^action_date_and_time^^%%relative%%<br />
          ^^calendar_event_start_date_and_time^^%%l, F j, Y \a\t g:i A%%<br />
          ^^calendar_event_end_date_and_time^^%%l, F j, Y \a\t g:i A%%</p>

          <p>NOTE: For "relative" date/time formatting, once the date goes beyond one
          month, the full date and/or time is displayed.</p>

        <td>Since any Action that triggers the creation of a new e-mail campaign could
        occur late at night or early in the morning, the actual time of day that the Auto
        Campaign should be sent may not be the best time, so you can enter a time of day
        to adjust the sending date/time of each campaign so that it is sent at the best
        time for the recipient.<br />
        <br />
        For example: Let's say you setup an Auto Campaign Profile to send a "thank you
        survey" 2 weeks after any Customer orders from your website. Say a Customer is up
        late one night and decides to place an order on your website at 1 AM.&nbsp;
        Without a way to adjust the schedule of the auto e-mail campaign, in 2 weeks the
        e-mail message would be sent to the Customer at 1 AM.&nbsp; Not an optimal time
        to make an impact with your message in their inbox! But, if you set 'Send at a
        specific time' to 11 AM, then the scheduled campaign would be adjusted to the
        closest 11 AM to the original scheduled date/time. Now you message is sent when
        it's optimal for you and your Customer.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><br />
  NOTE:&nbsp; The scheduled date &amp; time is always at least the full length (e.g. 1
  day) away from the action/event date &amp; time. Then, if there is a specific time set,
  the scheduled date &amp; time is pushed either further back in time (for "before") or
  pushed further forward in time (for "after") to the next occurrence of the specific
  time. For example, if the event start date &amp; time is on Friday at 12:00 PM, and the
  profile is set so that the e-mail is sent 1 day before the event starts, with a
  specific time of 1:00 PM, then the scheduled date &amp; time will be Wednesday at 1:00
  PM. The scheduled date &amp; time is not set to Thursday at 1:00 PM because that is not
  a full day before the event start date &amp; time.</p>
