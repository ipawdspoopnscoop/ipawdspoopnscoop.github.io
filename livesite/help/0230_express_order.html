  <h1>Express Order Page Type</h1>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can combine the functionality of the Shopping
  Cart, Billing Information, and the Order Preview Pages all in one Page, for a fast
  checkout process.</p>

  <p>This combined checkout page is ideal if you are not shipping products, but are
  collecting payments for softgoods like donations, memberships, downloads, and recurring
  services fees. Although shipping will also be handled from this page, it will be a
  disconnect for your customers because it will take them "backwards" to collect the
  shipping information.</p>

  <p>The way to use this Page Type is to link to it directly from your Order Forms using
  the "Next Page" field. Then you can link this Page Type to an Order Receipt Page using
  the "Next Page" field as well.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you are collecting credit/debit card information on this Page, then it is
  required for PCI compliance that your site have an SSL certificate and that secure mode
  be enabled. Please contact your hosting provider for more information about an SSL
  certificate, and please see the Site Settings for more information about secure
  mode.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

        <td>This label allows you to customize the system messages displayed for this
        page.<br />
        TIP: You only need to place one or two words here. For example, if you are
        creating a retail storefront, you might want this label to be "Gift Bag". Then
        when your shopping cart is empty,&nbsp; the message "Your Gift Bag is Empty."
        would be displayed.</td>
