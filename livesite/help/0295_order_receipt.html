        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Product Description Type:</td>

        <td>Select whether you want the full description or short description for
        Products to appear. The full description is generally large and contains HTML, so
        it is better for webpages. The short description is generally smaller and
        contains plain text, so it is better for e-mails.</td>
