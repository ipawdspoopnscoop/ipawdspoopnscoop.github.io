  <h1>My Campaign Profiles</h1>

  <p>In addition to manually created E-mail Campaigns, there is another way to deliver
  effective messages via e-mail to the right person and the right time.&nbsp; And it's
  fully automated!</p>

  <p>Auto Campaigns are personalized e-mail campaigns that are triggered by an action
  taken by an individual visitor to your website.&nbsp; Auto Campaigns are dynamic,
  meaning they may be different for each visitor and are sent to each visitor (recipient)
  at different times based on the action they take.<br />
  <br />
  Auto Campaigns are different than manual E-mail Campaigns in that they are not
  scheduled to be delivered on a specific date and time to a broad audience of recipients
  by the Site Manager.&nbsp; Instead, they are create and scheduled to be delivered to
  each individual recipient after some period of time based on when an action is taken by
  the visitor themselves.</p>

  <p>Auto Campaigns can be stringed together to create a personalized series of
  campaigns, custom tailored to each visitor based on the Actions they have taken on your
  site.</p>

  <p>Campaign Profiles are used to setup what message is to be sent to the recipient,
  when, and what Action triggers these new E-mail Campaigns. Once an Auto Campaign is
  created, you can view and manage it from the My Campaigns screen.</p>

  <p>Here are some examples of Auto Campaigns:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>E-mail a customer survey form 45 days after a customer orders from your online
    store.</li>

    <li>E-mail an order reminder to a customer for an upcoming event, like an event
    reservation, membership renewal, or a gift giving occasion.</li>

    <li>E-mail a follow-up message to a prospective customer that submits a customer
    service form.</li>

    <li>E-mail a customer service survey to a customer 7 days after they submit a support
    ticket form.</li>

    <li>Email a series of special offers each week to a prospect that has joined your
    mailing list.</li>

    <li>Send event reminders before and follow-up survey after an event they have
    registered for.</li>
  </ul>
