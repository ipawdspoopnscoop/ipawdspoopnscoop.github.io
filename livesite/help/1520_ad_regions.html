  <h1>All Ad Regions</h1>

  <p>Ad Regions are shared content areas that you can create for your Site Managers and
  some Content Managers to maintain directly from a Page using the Rich-text Editor.</p>

  <p>Ad Regions are ideal for rotating home page announcements, product tour slideshows,
  or traditional rotating graphical ad banners.</p>

  <p>Ad&nbsp;Regions are "safe", meaning your Site Managers and some Content Managers
  cannot edit or delete them, but they can add edit, reorder, label, or delete the
  Ads&nbsp;that appear within the Ad Regions.</p>

  <p>Since Ad&nbsp;Regions are placed into Page Styles, they become shared content that
  can be displayed on one, some, or all of your website Pages.</p>

  <p>Like Common Regions, Ad&nbsp;Regions must be created manually by the Site Designer
  before Ads can be created for them.</p>

  <p>Once you have created the Ad&nbsp;Region, add an &lt;ad&gt; tag to one, some, or all
  of your Pages Styles to specify the location and scope of your Ad&nbsp;Region across
  your website's Pages.</p>

  <p>If a dynamic Ad Region contains more than one Ad, then previous &amp; next buttons
  can appear which allow Visitors to browse through the Ads. Site Designers can
  enable/disable and position these buttons via the Theme Designer for System Themes or
  enable/disable, position, and style these buttons in the CSS for Custom Themes.</p>

  <h2>Searching Ad Regions</h2>

  <p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for any Ad Region
  by it's properties.</p>
