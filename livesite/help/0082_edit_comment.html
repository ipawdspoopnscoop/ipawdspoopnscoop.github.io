        might want to use this feature once a Page/Item collects too many comments and
        you want to collapse most of them so that the Add Comment form is more obvious
        and easier to navigate too. This feature is also great for product reviews where
        you want to highlight the best reviews (comments) on your Page/Item.<br />
        <br />
        To enable Featured Comments, select at least one Comment to be featured and save
        the Comment. Once enabled, only Featured Comments will be displayed by default
        when a Visitor browses to the Page/Item. They can toggle between the Comments
        displayed by selecting "Show All" or "Show Featured".<br />
