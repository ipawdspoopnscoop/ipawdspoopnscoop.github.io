  <h1>All Visitor Reports</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Visitor Reports created and saved by any Visitor Report
  Manager.</p>

  <p>The Visitor Profile provide insight about your website visitors that is not possible
  with web analytics software like Google Analytics. This is because web analytics cannot
  co-relate the bulk of website traffic with the interactive features and work-flow built
  into a data-driven website.</p>

  <p>Most website analytics programs offer you only totals: Visitors, Page Views, Top
  Pages, etc. What they can't tell you is what your website <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">audience</span> looks like and <span style=
  "font-weight: bold;">how</span> they interact with your website.</p>

  <p>Visitor Profiles make it easy to answer important questions like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What website did they come from?</li>

    <li>What e-mail Campaign are they responding too?</li>

    <li>What search what search engine referred them?</li>

    <li>What are they searching for?</li>

    <li>Which one of our ads did they click on?</li>

    <li>What was the last page they visited before landing on our website?</li>

    <li>Was it their first time at our website?</li>

    <li>Are they very interested in what we have to offer?</li>

    <li>What is the most popular landing page on our website?</li>

    <li>Did they submit a Custom Form?</li>

    <li>Did they begin an Order?</li>

    <li>Did they retrieve a Saved Cart?</li>

    <li>Did they start to checkout but never finish?</li>

    <li>Did they place an Order?</li>

    <li>Was the Customer referred to us by an Affiliate?</li>

    <li>What Currency did they prefer while Ordering?</li>

    <li>What language do they prefer while browsing?</li>

    <li>What is the most popular product Ordered or donation made?</li>

    <li>What is the most popular form submitted on our website?</li>
  </ul>

  website. The Who's Online feature displays all site visitors who are browsing your
  public web pages in real-time and their worldwide geographical location.</p>

  of this feature as follows:</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Red:</span> The feature has not been enabled for
  your website yet. Click the Who's Online button to signup for a free, no obligation
  account with WebsiteAlive that will allow you free access to their monitoring service
  to track your site visitors in real-time. You only need to do this once.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yellow:</span> Your free account has been created
  sucessfully and page tracking will start automatically within moments. You can click on
  the Who's Online button at anytime to launch the Site Monitor in a new browser window.
  You will need to login with your Website Alive account login. Once logged in, the Site
  Monitor will refresh itself every several seconds and show you real-time visitor
  information.</p>

  <p>If you decide later to add chat features to your website, you need to click on the
  Who's Online button, login to your Site Monitor account, and click on the "Add Chat..."
  link. You will be redirected to WebsiteAlive where you can order one of their plans.
  Once you order the plan, your free WebsiteAlive account will be upgraded automatically
  and all Chat Regions will begin to function instantly.</p>

  <p>IMPORTANT: If you decide to upgrade to the chat feature, you MUST click on "Add
  Chat..." link WITHIN the Site Monitor window. If you go to the WebsiteAlive website to
  order without clicking the "Add Chat" link within the Site Monitor window, your chat
  feature will not begin to work automatically.</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Green:</span> Your free account has been
  successfully upgraded and the built-in chat feature is now active!</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you don't see the Chat Button appear on your public pages immediately, be
  sure that you have a Chat Region defined in the Page Styles used by your Pages. Also be
  sure that Who's Online is enabled in Site Settings and that the Online Chat Button
  and/or Offline Chat Button is not set to to "-None-".</p>
