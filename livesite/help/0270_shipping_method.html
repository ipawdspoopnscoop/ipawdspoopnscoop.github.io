  <h1>Shipping Method Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Shipping Method Page evaluates the Product's shipping attributes for the
  recipient's address against the Shipping Methods and Zones and the Requested Arrival
  Date to determine the available shipping methods and costs. These shipping methods are
  then displayed in ascending order based on cost.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
