  <p>This screen displays a Currency and it's properties.</p>

  <table class="field">

        <td>
          Enter the name of this Currency that will be displayed on all Commerce Pages
          and selectable to the Customer.

          <p>For Example: "US Dollars".</p>

        <td>
          <p>Check this box if this is the standard Currency that your business operates
          around. There can only be one base Currency. The base Currency will be the
          Currency that you use to enter amounts, in the control panel. It will also be
          the default Currency that will appear to Customers on commerce Pages.</p>

          <p>When an Order is completed, the amount that is sent to your payment
          service/gateway will be in the base Currency, even if a Customer selected to
          view prices in a different Currency. Also, the payment service/gateway will be
          instructed by this system to complete the transaction in the base Currency.</p>

          <p>You will need to check that your payment service/gateway supports your base
          Currency. This system will send Currency info to most of the popular payment
          services/gateways via their API's. In general this system will probably support
          any base Currency that your payment service/gateway supports, however please
          see exceptions below.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Authorize.Net does not allow the Currency to be passed via their API for
            recurring transactions, so you will need to check if they support your base
            Currency at your account or processor level for recurring transactions.</li>

            <li>For ClearCommerce / Payfuse, this system only supports the following base
            Currencies: USD, AUD, CAD, EUR, and GBP.</li>

            <li>First Data Global Gateway does not allow the Currency to be passed via
            their API, so you will need to check if they support your base Currency at
            your account or processor level.</li>

            <li>Sage Payment Solutions does not allow the Currency to be passed via their
            API, so you will need to check if they support your base Currency at your
            account or processor level.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please be aware that this system assumes the base Currency has a format with
          2 decimal places (e.g. $1.99). This system might not work for you if your base
          Currency does not support decimal places or has more than 2 decimal places.</p>

          <p>The system does not keep track of the base Currency that was in use when an
          Order was completed. It assumes that all Orders were placed with the current
          base Currency. In other words, once you change your base Currency, past Orders
          will show the same old total value, but show the new base Currency symbol, so
          the amount might appear to be incorrect. Because of this, you should not change
          your base Currency often.</p>

        data.<br />
        <br />
        For Example: "USD".<br />
        <br />
        It is important to enter the correct, internationally recognized, standard code
        for the Currency, because this code may be sent to your payment
        service/gateway.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Exchange Rate:</td>

        <td>The current rate of exchange for this Currency, as compared to your base
        Currency. Your base Currency should always have an exchange rate of "1".<br />
        <br />
        TIP: Use the "Update Exchange Rate" button on the "All Currencies" screen to
        update this value instantly.<br />
        <br />
        IMPORTANT: Don't alter this value by hand unless you are sure that it is not
        being updated automatically.</td>
