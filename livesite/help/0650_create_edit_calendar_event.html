  at any time to change what information is displayed on any Calendar Pages that
  reference this event's Calendar.</p>

        TIP: It is a good idea to keep this text short, or at least use shorter words in

        a small area of a Page.</td>

        time. If you check this, then you will only need to enter dates for the start and
        end dates, rather than entering dates &amp; times. Also, if you check this, then
        no time information will be outputted for the Event on the Calendar.</td>

        Event will repeat and select the interval. For example, if the Event will occur a
        total of two times, then you would enter "1" for the number, because the Event
        only repeats one time.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: When creating repeating Events that span several days make sure that the
        repeating frequency does not allow any overlap in the Event dates.</td>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 2em;">By:</td>

        <td>
          <p>If you selected "Month(s)" for the interval, then two options will appear.
          Select "Day of the Month", if you want the Event to take place on the same
          calendar day each month (e.g. the 15th). Select "Day of the Week" if you want
          the Event to take place on the same day of the week each month (e.g. first
          Friday, second Sunday, last Thursday, or etc.). For both options, the system
          looks at the start date to automatically determine which date to use for future
          months.</p>

          <p>For "Day of the Week", if the start date is the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th
          occurrence of that day of the week, in the month, then that occurrence number
          is used for determining the repeating date in future months. However, if the
          start date is the 5th occurrence of the day of the week, in the month, then the
          last occurrence of that day of the week is used for future months (i.e. not
          necessarily the 5th occurrence, because that might not exist). In other words,
          if the start date is the 5th Sunday of that month, then the last Sunday will be
          used for future months.</p>

        number of repeating Events to manage a large number of individual
        reservations.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: This feature would be enabled if you were accepting hourly reservations for

        NOTE: For example, if you have a sports gym to rent out, and you want to allow
        anyone to reserve the gym each day from 1pm-4pm, you would create a repeating
        Event from 1pm-4pm (repeating daily for as many weeks out as you wish). The

        this value at any time to change the available inventory.<br />

        NOTE: When 'Manage Reservations Separately for each Repeating Instance' is
        enabled, this value will reflect the inventory available for the specific Event
