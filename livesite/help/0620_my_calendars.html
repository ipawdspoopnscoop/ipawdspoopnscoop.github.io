  <h1>My Calendars</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Calendars that you have access to. &nbsp;You can create
  an unlimited number of Calendars for any type of organization. &nbsp;Calendars are
  managed by Calendar Managers, so you can delegate the control of each Calendar to a
  specific User.</p>

  <h2>Viewing Calendars</h2>

  <p>Click on the Calendar you wish to view.</p>

  <h2>Creating Calendars</h2>

  <p>If you have access to create a Calendar, click "Create Calendar" which will be
  visible on this screen.</p>

  <h2>Deleting Calendars</h2>

  <p>If you have access to delete a Calendar, click "Edit&nbsp;Calendar Properties" and
  then click "Delete".</p>

  <p>TIP: To protect you from accidentally deleting all the Calendar Events, a
  confirmation warning message will be displayed if you attempt to delete a Calendar
  without first deleting all the Calendar's Events. &nbsp;If you see this message, you
  must first delete all of the Calendar's Events before you can delete the Calendar.</p>

  <p>NOTE:&nbsp;If you delete a Calendar, it will no longer appear on any Calendar Pages
  that might have referenced it.</p>
