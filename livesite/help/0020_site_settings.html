          NOTE: Typically, in less than 24 hours, your changes will take effect across
          the Internet, and your Visitors begin to be directed to this web server by
          accessing this website using either http://www.mydomain.com,
          http://mydomain.com, or http://anythinghere.mydomain.com.<br />
          <br />
          IMPORTANT: This is not the same as your DNS Server Address, so you should not
          need to change your Primary DNS Server or Secondary DNS Server address.<br />
          <br />
          TIP: If your registrar allows you to also change the TTL, set it to the lowest
          number they allow. This value sets the minutes between updates, and therefore
          instructs the DNS servers to update their information more quickly.

            If you uncheck secure mode and then click save, you might be logged out of the system.

          <p>Social Networking is a great way to allow visitors to your website to share
          your Page content with the public. We make this easy and flexible. Not only can
          you select exactly what social networking buttons and features you want to
          enable for your website audience, but you can also select the positioning of
          the buttons on your Pages. Since best practices dictate that these buttons
          should be positioned next to the content to be shared, you can easily display
          the buttons around the Primary System Region ("Use Page") of any Page. The
          Primary System Region is the perfect anchor location for the buttons since it
          typically contains a Page's unique content and is the only region required to
          be present on all Page Styles.</p>

          <p>See Pages Styles for more information about positioning your social
          networking buttons on your Pages.</p>

          <p>Please be aware that the social networking buttons will only appear on a
          Page if all of the following conditions are met:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>At least one social networking service is enabled.</li>

            <li>The Page is in a Public Folder.</li>

            <li>The Page has one of the following page types: Standard, Folder View,
            Photo Gallery, Custom Form, Form List View, Form Item View, Form View
            Directory, Calendar View, Calendar Event View, Catalog, Catalog Detail, or
            Order Form.</li>

            <li>The Page contains a "Use Page" System Region (see below for more
            information).</li>

            <li>The Page is not being sent as an E-mail Campaign.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please make sure that the Hostname in the Site Settings is set to the
          correct/standard hostname for your website, because it will be used in all
          URL's that are shared.</p>

          <p>TIP: Some times one or more of these social networking sites can be slow in
          responding, or offline temporarily. This will slow performance of your web
          pages because data is fetched from these sites each time one of your (Public)
          Pages is loaded. If you find your (Public) Pages loading slowly, consider
          disabling one or all of the social networking sites temporarily until these
          sites are back to responding quickly again.</p>

          people. A number may also appear next to each button which indicates the total
          number of times that the Page has been shared through that social networking
          service.

          <p>When you enable Facebook, a send button and a like button will appear. The
          send button is used for privately sharing a link with groups and individuals,
          and the like button is used for publicly sharing a link on your profile.</p>

          <p>Facebook sometimes displays an image next to a comment that someone has
          added when "liking" a Page. For Catalog, Catalog Detail, and Order Form Pages,
          Facebook will use the image that is set in the Product Group or Product
          properties. For all other types of Pages, Facebook will try to automatically
          find an image on the Page.</p>

          Apply for an Internet Merchant Account with your depository bank. (You do not
          need to purchase the banks' third-party gateway or software. They will try to
          tell you that you need it, but you do not!)<br />
          <br />
          The Internet Merchant Account will allow you to connect your website with the
          banking system so that payments made through your website can to be deposited
          securely into your bank account.<br />
          <br />

          supported payment gateways (above) and apply for an account with them. They
          will need this information in order to set up an account for you. Each payment
          gateway requires a service contract and the fees will vary. Please contact them
          directly for more information.<br />

          <p>PayPal Express Checkout is good if you don't want to hassle with getting a
          merchant account from your bank. The advantage to accepting PayPal is that your
          international customers and others that don't trust you with their credit card
          information will likely purchase from you. The disadvantage over a payment
          gateway is that PayPal is actually collecting the funds and you are paid at a
          later date.</p>

          <p>To use PayPal Express Checkout you simply need a PayPal business account.
          You can generally convert any PayPal account into a business account for free.
          Once you have the correct account type, then follow their processes in order to
          get an API Username, API Password, and API Signature for PayPal Express
          Checkout. Once you have that information, then enter it into the site settings

          <p>Please be aware that you can enable both the credit/debit card payment
          method and the PayPal Express Checkout payment method at the same time. The
          credit/debit card payment method will allow you to take credit/debit cards
          directly on your website, normally with a payment gateway account, and the
          PayPal Express Checkout payment method will allow your Customers to pay via
          credit/debit card or their PayPal account on PayPal's website. The two payment
          methods will appear as two different choices on the Express Order or Order
          Preview Page.</p>

          <p>With PayPal Express Checkout the entire ordering process (e.g. adding
          Products to the cart, checking out, order receipt), except for making payment,
          will still take place on your website.</p>

          to prefill fields or show information to the Customer. Information for all
          Products in the Order (e.g. description, price) will also be sent and should
          appear to the Customer on PayPal's site. Product information is only sent if
          there is no gift card applied to an Order, due to complications with PayPal
          concerning gift cards.</p>

        <br />
        Here's how it works: If a Group Offer is selected, every time an Affiliate Signup
        Form Page is submitted (e.g. a new affiliate), the system will instantly create a
        corresponding Key Code to this Group Offer using the affiliate's own Affiliate
        Code. This allows any shopper that uses the Affiliate's Code when ordering to not
        only provide the affiliate with commission, but also receive a discount as
        defined by the Group Offer. This concept creates more incentive for the shopper
        to use the Affilite's Code since it doubles as an offer code too. Promoting this
        unique concept to your affiliates will produce more traffic and orders.</td>

        to determine what tracking codes are considered "pay-per-click" visits to your
        website.<br />
        <br />
        Lets say you place an ad on a search engine or other website and you want to
        track the referring paid clicks vs. the free clicks. You want to apply that
        tracking information to create a Visitor Report to determine how many Pages,
        Orders, Submitted Forms, or Membership Registrations, for example, were received
        from the specific website or ad.<br />
        <br />
        To do this, you might create a link to a page and tracking code like this:
        "/pages/home?t=ppc_google_ad_number1"<br />
        <br />
        If you set this flag to "ppc_", then any visits with a tracking code that
        contains "ppc_" would be considered a pay-per-click referral, and will appear as
        such on all Visitor Reports.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: The flag only modifies the Reports, and not the underlying visitor data, so
        you can change this flag at any time and the Visitor Reports will be recalculated
        for you.</td>
