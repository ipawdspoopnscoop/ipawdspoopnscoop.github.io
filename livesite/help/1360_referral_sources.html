  <h1>All Referral Sources</h1>

  <p>This screen displays any optional Referral Sources.&nbsp;By asking for a Referral
  Source helps your marketing or communications team learn how your Customers found out
  about your products and/or services.</p>

  <p>Referral Sources are the selectable answers you provide to the question "How did you
  hear about us?".&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This question is asked of each Customer on the Order Preview Page, or Express Order
  Page during the checkout process.</p>

  <p>Examples of Referral Sources:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Internet Search</li>

    <li>News Story</li>

    <li>A Customer</li>

    <li>A Friend</li>

    <li>Direct Mail</li>

    <li>Radio Ad</li>

    <li>Print Ad</li>

    <li>TV Ad</li>

    <li>Other</li>
  </ul>

  <p>TIP: This feature is optional and can be disabled (and your Customers will not be
  prompted) simply by deleting all your Referral Sources from the system.</p>
