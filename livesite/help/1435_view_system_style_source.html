  <h1>View Source</h1>

  <p>For Designers that want to look under the hood, this screen is helpful by displaying
  the underlying HTML page* that is created by the Style Designer*, and optionally append
  HTML code to the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tag.</p>

  <h2>Additional Head Content</h2>

  <p>Although the Source needs to remain unaltered for the system to work well, System
  Page Styles can be expanded with additional functionality by placing code in the
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tag of the Page Style. This is ideal if you need to add
  third-party widgets, javascript functions and libraries, or including CSS files to
  override all or part of the active System Theme's CSS.</p>

  <p>You can enter any valid HTML into the Additional Head Content area. Click 'Save
  &amp; Preview' to update the Source and view your changes in the Sourve window. Click
  'Save &amp; Return' to add your head content and return to the System Page Style. Click
  'Cancel' to abort you most recent 'Save' operation.</p>

  <p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag can be inserted anywhere
  in your HTML and is replaced automatically with the absolute URL to the location where
  your system software was installed. You should always use the <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag if you need to reference any uploaded files
  within your HTML. This makes your links portable, so if you ever need to move the
  software system to another directory within your web server, your hand-coded links will
  still work.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Let's look at a typical example.</strong></p>

  <p>Say you want to link to a CSS file (example.css) that you uploaded through the
  Design Files within the Control Panel. However, you want to be sure that the link is
  portable because your web server administrator originally installed the system software
  into a temporary directory that looked something like this: <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">http://192.168.0.1/~example/software</span> and will need to
  move the system software to <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">http://www.example.com/software</span> once you have setup
  your domain and are ready to launch the site.</p>

  <p>So if you hard-code your link to example.png file like this:<br />
  <br />
  <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">http://192.168.0.1/~example/software/files/example.css</span>
  or<br />
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">/files/example.css</span><br />
  <br />
  Then when the system software is moved later to another directory, this link would no
  longer work. So instead, be sure to link to the file using the <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag:<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}files/example.css</span></p>

  <p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag is only necessary within
  your custom HTML such as Custom Page Styles, Editable Head Content in System Page
  Styles, Designer Regions, and within custom CSS files. The <span style=
  "font-family: monospace;">{path}</span> tag is not necessary when adding links through
  the Rich-text Editor. These links will be converted automatically for you when the
  content region is saved.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you are the web server administrator and move the system to another
  directory off of your webroot after installation, be sure to update your .htaccess file
  per the system's installation / update instructions.</p>

  <h2>Source (read-only)</h2>

  <p>The Source is a read-only copy the currently saved System Page Style. This HTML code
  has been designed to work specifically with the active Theme (CSS file generated by the
  Theme Designer) and to be as compact as possible, and render well on all popular
  browsers and web devices.</p>

  <p>TIP: View Source makes it even easier to create special function Custom Page Styles
  within your website, even if the rest of your site is using System Page Styles and the
  active Theme. Paste the entire Source into a new Custom Page Style, add your own
  additional HTML code to it, and create specialized pages within your site that still
  inherit their design from your active Theme!</p>

  <p>TIP: The System Page Style Name and Page Style Layout is added to the
  &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tag of all System Page Styles to provide more flexibility and
  control over styling. Couple this with the ability to add your own CSS advanced styling
  within the Theme Designer and you can code some highly custom designs using only System
  Page Styles and System Themes!</p>

  <p>* It may be important to know that not all HTML code is displayed within View
  Source. Additional javascript snippets are included when a Page is rendered if any of
  the built-in features including Who's Online, Chat, Social Networking, or Google
  Analytics are enabled. These code snippets are completely invisible and will not alter
  content or design in any way. These code snippets are NOT included when Pages are
  e-mailed through the E-mail Campaign feature. See Site Settings for more information.
  In addition, the JQuery javascript library is also included if any animated Menu
  Regions or Ad Regions are found in the Page Style.</p>
