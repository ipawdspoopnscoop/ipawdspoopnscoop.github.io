  <h1>Create / Edit Ad Region</h1>

  <p>Ad Regions control the nature of ads within them. The dimensions of an Ad Region are
  defined, by the Site Designer, using CSS (Theme). However, Ad Region function is
  controlled by the Ad Region's properties. Using these properties, you can create
  "Static" Ad Regions that rotate ads randomly each time a page is loaded, or create
  "Dynamic" Ad Regions that will display each ad in succession without the need to reload
  the page.</p>

  <p>Dynamic Ad Regions can also create interesting presentation-style areas within a
  page using the built-in transition effects.</p>

  <p>Here are the Ad Region Properties:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>
          <h3>Ad Region Name</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Ad Region Name:</td>

        <td>This is the unique Ad&nbsp;Region name.&nbsp; This is the name that will be
        inserted into any Page Style between the &lt;ad&gt;&lt;/ad&gt; tags.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: If you change this Name, be sure to update the tag's name in the Page
        Styles.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>
          <h3>Ad Region&nbsp;Behavior</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Display Type:</td>

        <td>This determines the Ad Regions display behavior.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Static:</span> Select this Display Type if you
        would like each Ad to change only when the Page is reloaded by the Visitor's
        browser. &nbsp;This Display Type is typically used for traditional advertising
        banner images.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic:</span>&nbsp;Select this Display Type if
        you would like multiple Ads to be displayed each time&nbsp;the Page is reloaded
        by the Visitor's browser. &nbsp;This Display Type is typically used for
        slideshow-style banners and to animate information panels.<br />
        <br />
        NOTE: Only Site Designers and Administrators can create, delete and rename Ad
        Regions. Site Managers and Users who have access to an Ad Region can edit it's
        properties.<br /></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 3.5em;">Transition Type:</td>

        <td>This determines the type of animation that is used for the Ad Region.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 3.5em;">Transition Duration:</td>

        <td>This determines how long the transition will take to complete.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 3.5em;">Enable Autoplay:</td>

        <td>This will enable/disable the Autoplay feature. When the Autoplay feature is
        enabled, the animation will start automatically. This feature is similar to an
        automatic slideshow.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 4.5em;">Interval:</td>

        <td>This is how long the Ad Region will wait before switching to the next
        Ad.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td style="padding-left: 4.5em;">Play Continuously:</td>

        <td>Check this if you do not want the animation to stop. In other words, once the
        last Ad is reached, then it will loop back around to the first Ad and continue
        the animation. If you uncheck this, then when the last Ad is reached, it will
        loop back around to the first Ad and stop the animation.</td>
      </tr>
