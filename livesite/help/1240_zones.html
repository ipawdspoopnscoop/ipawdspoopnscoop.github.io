  <h1>All Shipping Zones</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Shipping &nbsp;Zones.</p>

  <p>Shipping Zones are simply geographical physical address areas of all Countries
  and/or their States that your organization can ship Products too.</p>

  <p>Shipping Zones can also adjust the shipping cost if some zones are more expensive to
  deliver too.</p>

  <p>Shipping Zones are used by Shipping Methods (to determine if any carriers can
  deliver to the zone) and by shippable Products (to limit delivery areas to specific
  zones).</p>

  <p>For each Shipping Zone, you can set the Base Rate, Primary Weight Rate, Secondary
  Weight Rate, Item Rate in order to affect the cost of shipping to a Shipping Zone.
  These values are used in association with the similar Properties in the Shipping
  Methods and Products.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Shipping Methods can share Shipping Zones but typically do not share costs
  (there is a per item rate if this is required for your exceptions).</p>

  <p>TIP: Typically Shipping Zones do not overlay each other. &nbsp;However, if you have
  complex shipping cost formulas, overlaying Shipping Zones will allow you to create many
  fee variations.</p>

  <p>To create a Shipping Zone, click "Create Shipping Zone".</p>
