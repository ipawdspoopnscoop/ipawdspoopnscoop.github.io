  <h1>My Home Pages</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Pages that you have access to that also have been
  selected as a "Home" Page.<br />
  <br />
  Home Pages are&nbsp;retrieved automatically whenever your&nbsp;website's root (i.e.
  http://www.mydomain.com/) is requested. You do not need to create an index.html page.
  &nbsp;Instead, you can designate any Page&nbsp;to be your Home Page.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  TIP:&nbsp;If you have enabled the Home Page feature&nbsp;for multiple Pages, each Home
  Page will randomly be selected and displayed&nbsp;each time a Visitor requests your
  website. &nbsp;This is useful if you want to rotate&nbsp;content on your website's home
  page.<br />
  <br />
  To set up a Page as a &nbsp;Home Page, edit the Page's Properties and select the "Home
  Page" option.</p>
