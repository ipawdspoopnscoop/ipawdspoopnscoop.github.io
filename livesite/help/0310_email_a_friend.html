  <h1>E-Mail a Friend Page Type</h1>

  <p>This Page Type offers your site Visitors with a way of e-mailing any Page to their
  friends or colleagues.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To use this feature, simply Create a Page with this Page Type, and create a link to
  the Page on any Page's content like:</p>

  <p>/pages/email_a_friend</p>

  <p>TIP: To add this feature to many Pages, add the link to a Common Region.</p>

  <p>When the link is clicked, a form is displayed that prompts the Visitor to enter some
  required(*) and optional fields so that an e-mail can be sent to the friend. &nbsp;A
  copy of the e-mail can also be sent to the Visitor if requested. &nbsp;When submitted,
  the Page is sent via e-mail.<br />
  <br />
  NOTE: For privacy reasons, the e-mail address(es) are not saved.<br />
  <br />
  Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Submit Button Label:</td>

        <td>Enter the text you wish to display on the "Submit" button.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Next Page:</td>

        <td>Select the Page on the website to direct the Visitor to when the Submit
        Button is clicked.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>SPAM Protection</h2>

  <p>Spammers use unprotected web forms in an attempt to use another's website to post
  and broadcast their own advertising. To combat this malicious technique, if CAPTCHA is
  enabled in the Site Settings then all Email-a-Friend Pages have a CAPTCHA feature that
  is automatically enabled if the Page is displayed to any site visitor that is not
  logged into the website. The CAPTCHA asks a simple challenge question that the visitor
  must answer correctly in order to submit the web form.</p>
