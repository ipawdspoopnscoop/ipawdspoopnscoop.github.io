  <h1>Import Products</h1>

  <p>You can Import Products into the system from any Comma Separated Values (CSV) File.
  CSV file format is a universally accepted way to move data between systems. Most
  spreadsheet programs and databases can save data as a CSV text file so it is an ideal
  way to upload and create Products automatically in the system.</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>

  <h2>Import from CSV file</h2>

  <p>Simply put your data into columns using a spreadsheet program and save as a .CSV file. Here
  are the guidelines for the CSV file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The first row of the CSV file must contain the product field names that you wish
    to import data for.</li>

    <li>You may use any number of columns from the list below.</li>

    <li>Columns can be listed in any order.</li>

    <li>If you are saving a CSV file on a Mac, you might need to select the "Windows CSV"
    format.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Available Columns</h3>

  <p>Here is the list of the valid Product Properties that you can import. Place one of
  the following on the first row of each of your data columns:</p>
