          All recurring profiles are enabled by default (this check box will be
          selected whenever the profile is first created).<br/><br/>

          Deselect this check box if you want to disable a Recurring Commission
          Profile. You can re-enable a profile at anytime, but remember, the
          system only looks forward so no Commissions will be retroactively created
          during the time a profile is disabled.
