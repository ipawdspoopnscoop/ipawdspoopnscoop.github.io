<h1>View Order</h1>
<p>This screen displays the details of a single Order.</p>
<p>Orders are the collection of information about a complete or incomplete e-commerce transaction.</p>
<p>If an Order requires shipping, you may insert one or more tracking numbers for each Ship To. You should enter one tracking number per line in the field. The tracking numbers will then appear on the view order screen in the my account area for the Customer. If the tracking number is from UPS, FedEx, or USPS, then the tracking number will be linked to a status page on the carrier's website.</p>
<p>If you initially only shipped some of the items that the Customer ordered (e.g. a product is out of stock), then you might want to update the shipped quantity to indicate to the Customer how many items were shipped. The ordered quantity and the shipped quantity will then appear on the view order screen in the my account area for the Customer. Once you have shipped the rest of the items to the Customer, then you can update the shipped quantity again to show that all items have been shipped. You can either leave this field blank so a shipped quantity does not appear to the Customer or you can enter any number that is greater than or equal to 0.</p>
<p>If the Order contains shippable items then you can click the printer icon for each recipient in order to print a packing slip. A pop-up window will appear with the packing slip and the print dialog will automatically appear. A packing slip can be included in the shipment in order to inform the recipient about what is included in the shipment. The quantity that appears on the packing slip is the ordered quantity. Shipped quantity does not appear on the packing slip.</p>
