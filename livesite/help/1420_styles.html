  <h1>All Page Styles</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all of the Page Styles defined for the website, and whether or
  not they are being used by any Page or Folder.</p>

  <p>Page Styles account for the "look and feel" of each Page, and can be defined at the
  Page level or the Folder level, so you can create one look for the entire website, or
  make each area of your website look different.</p>

  <p>Page Styles control the overall layout of each Page, so it will define the number
  and location of the Menu Region, Common Regions, and Page Regions that are editable by
  your Site Managers and Content Managers.</p>

  <p>Page Styles also define the location of any additional Designer Regions, Dynamic
  Regions, and Login Regions that only your Site Designers have access too.</p>

  <p>Page Styles are the containers that hold the complete HTML page (HTML, javascript,
  CSS, images, etc.) that surround each Page and it's content.</p>

  <p>To better understand Page Styles, consider this example: A print magazine might have
  the follow page layouts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover</li>

    <li>Table of Contents</li>

    <li>Articles</li>

    <li>Feature Story</li>

    <li>Advertisements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Even through there are only five layouts, an entire 120 page magazine can be built
  with them. This provides consistency in the design, and simplifies the printing
  process.</p>

  <p>Page Styles work the same way, only for your website. So even if you have a 1,000
  page website to build, you may only need four Page Styles:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Home Page Style</li>

    <li>Interior Page Style</li>

    <li>Pop Up Page Style</li>

    <li>Contact Us Page Style</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also create Mobile Page Styles so you can display any design or layout that
  best fits a mobile phone screens and the system will automatically detect the device
  and switch Page Styles. Two Page Styles can be made available for a Page to use. One
  for desktop (computers and tablets) visitors and one for mobile (phone) visitors. The
  system will automatically detect and switch Page Styles based on the device that
  accesses any web page on the site. We recommend that your Site Designer add a Mobile
  Switch Region to all Page Styles so any site visitors can choose which Page Style they
  wish to view regardless of the outcome of the automatic detection.</p>

  <p>Of course, you can add as many Page Styles are you need for your website.</p>

  <h2>Searching Styles</h2>

  <p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for any Style by
  it's properties.</p>

  <h2>Creating Page Styles</h2>

  <p>To create a Page Style, click on "Create Page Style".</p>

  <h2>Modifying &amp; Deleting Page Styles</h2>

  <p>You can modify or delete any Page Style that is not being used by a Page. For safely
  sake, the system will not allow you to delete a Page Style that is in use by a Page and
  it's content.</p>

  <p>NOTE: It may be important to know that some javascript code snippets may be inserted
  into Page Styles dynamically as they render Pages. These code snippets provide support
  for built-in features including Who's Online, Chat, and Google Analytics. These
  snippets are designed to be compact and not interfere with any other valid code you
  decide to include in your Page Styles. However, no code snippets are included for Pages
  when they are sent as E-mail Campaigns as they can cause delivery or viewing issues for
  recipients.</p>
