  <h1>Affiliate Sign Up Form Page Type</h1>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can use the automated Affiliate Program
  features that are built into the system. This page allow you to customize the signup
  process. Before you begin, you need to refer to the Site Settings help regarding
  enabling the Affiliate Program and it's options before accepting affiliate applications
  on your website.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Terms Page:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>The Page that they must have read and agreed to before the Affiliate Sign Up
          Form Page can be submitted.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Submit Button Label:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Enter the text you wish to display for the clickable Submit button.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Next Page:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>The Page that you want the system to go to when the Submit Button is
          clicked.&nbsp; This is typically a confirmation page that you can create using
          the Affiliate Sign Up Confirmation Page Type to provide them with a
          confirmation of the information they entered.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

  <h2>Setting up an Affiliate Program</h2>

  <p>In order for Affiliates to refer business to your website and receive a commission,
  they need to create their own unique Affiliate Code first. This code can be entered
  into the Offer Code field in a Shopping Cart or Express Order page, or can be added to
  a coded link that their own site Visitors will click to get to your website. This
  personalized Affiliate Code is selected by each Affiliate when an affiliate signs up
  and is approved.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Here is how it works:</span></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Enable the Affiliate Program properties in the Site Settings.</li>

    <li>Add a link to the Affiliate Sign Up Form Page to any Page on your website.</li>

    <li>When an interested affiliate comes across your Affiliate Sign Up Form, they will
    fill it out. &nbsp;They will be asked to login or register first (since we need to
    create a User account for them),</li>

    <li>Once the affiliate has submitted the form, they will then be shown the Affiliate
    Confirmation Page, where you can tell them what your next steps might be (approval
    process requires, time frames, etc).</li>

    <li>If "Automatically Approve Affiliates" is not enabled in Site Settings, then the
    Site Administrator will be notified of the submitted application and pending approval
    request via e-mail. A link in the e-mail will direct the Site Administrator to
    approve or reject the affiliate by selecting the "Approved" check box found on the
    Affiliate's Contact.</li>

    <li>If approval is granted, or if "Automatically Approve Affiliates" is enabled, the
    affiliate will be sent the Affiliate Welcome Page immediately, which will also
    include the unique Affiliate Code they specified, along with a link to your website,
    and any other information you wish to add to the Affiliate Welcome page. The
    Affiliate Code will be active once approved, so so will the optional Group Offer if
    specified in Site Settings before the affiliate signed up.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>NOTE: You can always change or remove an affiliates status or percentage by editing
  the Affiliate Information section of the Contact associated with their User account. If
  you are using the Group Offer feature, you can also remove/change/add that offer for
  any affiliate by editing the Key Codes under the Commerce tab.</p>
