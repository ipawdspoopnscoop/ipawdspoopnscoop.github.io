  <h1>Shipping Methods</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Shipping Methods.</p>

  <p>Shipping Methods define each shipping carrier and their methods of
  shipment,&nbsp;and the fees for each based on the available Shipping Zone for each
  Shipping Method.</p>

  <p>For each Shipping Method, you can set Base Rate, Primary Weight Rate, Secondary
  Weight Rate and an Item Rate in order to determine the cost of shipping.</p>

  <p>Shipping Methods are displayed on the Shipping Methods Page &nbsp;All available
  Shipping Methods that can deliver the Products to each destination are always displayed
  to the Customer starting with the least expensive first.</p>

  <h2>Guaranteed Arrival Dates</h2>

  <p>For Each Shipping Method you can also set the number of day the shipment is in
  transit. These transit days are important if you are using the optional Arrival Date
  feature and therefore only offer the Customer the Shipping Methods that you can
  guarantee will deliver the Products to the recipients on time. Transit days can also be
  impacted by the destination Country so you can also adjust the transit days for any
  Country.</p>

  <p>Base Transit Days is used in determining the number of transit days (calendar days)
  for that Shipping Method. If Adjust Transit is checked, then the Transit Adjust Days
  for the Country of the recipient will be added to the Base Transit Days of the Shipping
  Method.</p>

  <p>If a Shipping Cut-off is configured for an Arrival Date, then the Preparation Time
  for Products, transit values for Shipping Methods, and Transit Adjustment Days for
  Countries are all ignored.</p>

  <h2>Street Address &amp; Post Office Box Delivery</h2>

  <p>If Allow Street Address is checked then this Shipping Method may be available for a
  recipient with a street address. (This is determined by a shipping address entered by
  the Customer starting with a numeric character).</p>

  <p>If Allow PO Box is checked then this Shipping Method may be available for a
  recipient with a PO box (shipping address entered starts with a non-numeric
  character).</p>

  <p>You will also need to set the Allowed Zones that this Shipping Method can deliver
  too.</p>

  <h2>Shipping Selection Process</h2>

  <p>1) The Customer selects the "Check Out" button from the Shopping Cart Page or the
  Express Order Page.<br />
  <br />
  The Cart's "Next Page (with shipping)" Page will be displayed if there are shippable
  Products in the Cart. This Next Page should be a&nbsp;Shipping Address &amp; Arrival
  Page. This Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Page will be shown for each recipient in the
  Cart.</p>

  <p>2) The Customer will enter the shipping address and select a&nbsp;Requested Arrival
  Date and press the "Continue" button.</p>

  <p>If no Shipping Methods can be found that will guarantee arrival of the shipment by
  the&nbsp;Requested Arrival Date, the Shipping Address &amp; Arrival Page will appear
  again with an error instructing theCustomer to change his/her Requested Arrival Date
  and press "Continue" again.</p>

  <p>3) If at least one Shipping Method is found, the Customer will be sent to the
  Shipping Method Page for the recipient.</p>

  <p>If there is a Product in the Cart that is not allowed to be shipped to the
  recipient's Country or State, the Product Restriction Message is displayed to the
  Customer on the Shipping Methods Page and the Customer is required to remove the
  Product from the Cart in order to continue with the checkout process.<br />
  <br />
  the system&nbsp;will look for all Shipping Methods for the recipient's address.&nbsp;
  the system will then refine the list of Shipping Methods to only those that can get the
  Products to the destination on or before the selected Requested Arrival Date.</p>

  <p>4) If the Customer started the checkout process from a Shopping Cart Page, they will
  be directed to the Billing Information Page to enter their payment information and
  proceed to finalize their Order.&nbsp;If the Customer started the checkout process from
  an Express Order Page, they will be sent back to the Express Order Page to enter their
  payment information and proceed to finalize their Order.</p>

  <h3>Available Shipping Methods Calculation</h3>

  <p>It is important to understand how the system determines what Shipping Methods are
  available for each recipient during the checkout process. &nbsp;Here is the
  calculation, if there is no Shipping Cut-off for the Arrival Date:</p>

  <p>Available Shipping Methods = Shipping Methods (ZONE MATCH): (longest
  Product:PreparationTime) + SHIP:BaseTransitDays + (If SHIP:AdjTransit = Y then
  CTRY:TransitAdjDays else 0) &lt;= Days until Requested Arrival Date (adjusted for End
  of Day Time).</p>

  <p>If there is a Shipping Cut-off for the selected Arrival Date, then the system will
  look at the Cut-off Date &amp; Time in order to determine if the Shipping Method should
  still be available.</p>

  <p>If one or more Available Shipping Methods are found then the shipping charges for
  each will be calculated and displayed to the Customer as follows:</p>

  <p>Shipping Method&nbsp;Shipping Surcharge = (SHIP:BaseRate) + (ZONE:BaseRate) + For
  all non-Free Shipping Products: (Product:PrimaryWeightPoints * SHIP:PrimaryWeightRate *
  ProdQty) + (Product:SecondaryWeightPoints * SHIP:SecondaryWeightRate * ProdQty) +
  (SHIP:ItemRate * ProdQty) + (Product:PrimaryWeightPoints * ZONE:PrimaryWeightRate *
  ProdQty) + (Product:SecondaryWeightPoints * ZONE:SecondaryWeightRate * ProdQty) +
  (ZONE:ItemRate * ProdQty) + (Product:ExtraShippingCost * ProdQty)</p>

  <p>TIP: The Extra Shipping Cost portion of the calculation above is generally used for
  Products that might require extra preparation time and/or expense.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If no Shipping Methods can be found for the shipping address, an error message
  will be displayed on the Shipping Methods Page and the Customer will need to contact
  you.&nbsp;So it's a good idea to at least create one Shipping Method that covers all
  your Shipping Zones if that is the appropriate solution for you.</p>
