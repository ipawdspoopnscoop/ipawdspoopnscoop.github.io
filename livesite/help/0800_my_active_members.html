  <h1>My Active Members</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all Contacts that have a Member ID and have a future Expiration
  Date.</p>

  <p>NOTE: The existence of a Member ID and future Expiration Date does not necessarily
  mean this Contact can view any Pages or Files in the Membership Folders yet. If the
  Contact is also found on the "Unregistered Members" screen, then they have not
  registered yet, and therefore do not have Membership Folder access.</p>

  <p>Members still must register either through:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>the Membership Entrance Page</li>

    <li>the Registration Entrance Page and purchase a membership Product</li>

    <li>the Registration Entrance Page and submit a membership trial Custom Form</li>
  </ol>

  <p>in order to create a User account that will allow them access until the Expiration
  Date passes.</p>
