        For example: If you wanted to charge $12.00 to ship a certain product in this
        Shipping Zone, you would set the Product's Primary Points to 1200 and set this
        value to 1.</td>

        Secondary Weigh Points for the recipient.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: Use the Secondary Weigh Rate for any Products that need a different Weight
        Rate for a&nbsp; different Shipping Zone.</td>

        TIP: Use the Item Rate when a flat shipping rate must be applied to all
        quantities, regardless of the Product.</td>

  TIP: You may need to divide up your Shipping Zones into new, smaller Shipping Zones to
  accommodate more complex shipping fee structures.</p>
