  <h1>My Miscellaneous Pages</h1>

  <p>The following Page Types are included in this category: E-mail a Friend, Error,
  Folder View, and Search Results.</p>

  <h2>Search Results Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type displays the search results from the Site Search feature. &nbsp;Links
  to Pages are displayed, along with each Page's Title and Description. &nbsp;If any
  Pages use the "Promote on Keyword" feature, then these Pages will be listed at the top
  of the Search Results Page. Also, if Search Products is enabled in the page properties,
  then Product Groups and Products will also appear in the search results.</p>

  <p>You can create multiple Search Results Pages. For example, you might want different
  Search Results pages to have different designs or properties. You can link to Search
  Results pages or create a search form where the action for the form points to the
  page.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Only "searchable" Pages are included in the Search Results Page, and of those
  Pages, only Pages that the searcher has access to will be visible.</p>

  <h2>Error Page</h2>

  <p>This Page Type is used for displaying error messages. For example, if a visitor
  requests a Page or File that no longer exists, then the visitor will be sent to this
  Page Type and an error will appear. You do not need to link to this Page Type directly.
  It will be displayed automatically when required.</p>

  <p>IMPORTANT:You should only have one Page with this Page Type on your website.</p>

  <h2>Folder View Page</h2>

  <p>The Folder View Page will list Folders, Pages, and Files that are inside of the same
  Folder as the Folder View Page and that the Visitor has access to. This Page Type is
  useful when you want to give your Visitors or Users a dynamic list of the content that
  they have access to. For example, you might want to use this Page Type for an intranet
  that shows private Pages that a User has access to.</p>

  <p>For some of these Page Types, the first Page that is found will be displayed if the
  page cannot be determined. &nbsp;If any of these Pages are missing from your website, a
  default page will be displayed for each Page Type so that your website will continue to
  function correctly.</p>

  <p>To create any of these Page Types,&nbsp;click on "Create Page".</p>
