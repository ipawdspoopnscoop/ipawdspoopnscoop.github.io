  <h1>Edit Menu</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all the Menu Items for this Menu.</p>

  <p>Each Menu Item will be added to the Menu on all Pages that share this Menu.</p>

  <p>If this is a multi-level Menu, then you can organize Menu Item together in
  parent/child relationships. You can create as many levels as you need, however,
  we recommend that you limit your levels to 3 or 4 for better usability.</p>

  <p>To create a new Menu Item, click on "Create Menu Item".</p>

  <p>NOTE: Content Managers who have edit access to specific Menu Regions and Site
  Managers can only edit the Menu Items for those Menus. Site Designers and Site
  Administrators can also edit the underlying Menu Region Properties.</p>

  <p>If you are a Site Designer, you can also click "Edit Menu Properties" to edit the
  Menu properties themselves from this screen.</p>
