  <h1>My Campaigns</h1>

  <p>This screen displays all current e-mail Campaigns that you can manage.</p>

  <p>Campaigns are a powerful way to keep in touch with prospects, members, customers,
  and others interested in what you do through e-newsletters, e-promotions, and
  e-announcements.<br />
  <br />
  Campaigns can be sent as plain text or HTML (by selecting a Page) to a one or more
  Contacts or Contact Groups.<br />
  <br />
  Only Contacts that have a valid e-mail address and have "opted-in" to receive e-mails
  will be included in any Campaign. We call these Contacts "Subscribers".<br />
  <br />
  Since Campaigns can be Pages, your website design, content styling, logo, and other
  branding can remain intact, so your image stays consistent and professional to all
  Subscribers.<br />
  <br />
  You can also add a personalization tag before you broadcast it, and the system will
  insert each Subscriber's name into every e-mail message.<br />
  <br />
  Campaigns can be paused, restarted, and canceled at any time before they have been
  completed. You can monitor a Campaign's Status at any time. Cancelled and Completed
  Campaigns are displayed only on the Campaign History screen.</p>

  <p>There are two types of Campaigns. Manual and Auto Campaigns. Here is a comparison of
  the differences between them:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Manual</strong></td>

        <td><strong>Auto</strong></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Created by a Campaign Manager to send a single e-mail message to many
        recipients (Contact Groups) all at the same time. E-mail blast and mass-mailing
        are terms that best describe this form of e-mail campaign.</td>

        <td>Orchestrated by a Campaign Manager, but triggered and created by each
        recipient themselves to send a single e-mail message to the recipient at a
        specific interval of time in the future.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Creation of each e-mail campaign is manual, but sending can be
        automated.</td>

        <td>Creation of the e-mail campaign is automated (and sending can be automated with a
        software subscrption).</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Sent to many recipients the same time.</td>

        <td>Sent to many recipients, all at different times.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Sent based on the actions of the Campaign Manager (by setting the date/time
        for delivery).</td>

        <td>Sent based on the actions of each recipient (setting their own delivery
        date/time, albeit unknowingly).</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Creating Manual Campaigns</h2>

  <p>You must be a Campaign Manager to create a Manual Campaign.<br />
  <br />
  If you are also a Content Manager, you can create a Campaign from any Page that you can
  edit. Modify the Page to your liking, and click "Create Campaign". &nbsp;Your Page will
  be selected by default.<br />
  <br />
  TIP: Be sure that you assign at least one Contact Group to your Campaign Managers so
  they have access to Contacts to send too. Likewise, you can also use this feature to
  restrict Campaign Managers to only sending Campaigns to their own Contact Groups.</p>

  <h2>Creating Auto Campaigns</h2>

  <p>You must be a Campaign Manager to create a Campaign Profile. You can't create an
  Auto Campaign manually, instead you create a Campaign Profile which in turn will create
  the campaign automatically when a Visitor triggers the Profile's Action.</p>

  <p>The access control for Auto Campaigns is the same as Manual Campaigns. Site
  Administrators, Site Designers, and Site Managers can edit any Campaign and Profile, as
  well as the Campaign Manager that created the Campaign Profile.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Auto Campaigns are automactically created with the status of "Paused" so they
  can be audited. For small websites with few actions and visitors this works well and no
  software subscription is required. For larger sites with many visitors and actions, if
  a software subscripton is detected, the system will automate the process of creation
  and sending of Auto Campaigns.</p>

  <h2>Viewing Campaigns</h2>

  <p>Click on the Campaign name that you want to view. Campaign Managers can only view
  and edit their own Campaigns. Site Managers can manage any Campaign.</p>

  <p>NOTE: This screen only shows Campaigns that are "Ready to Send" or "Paused". If you
  change the status of any Campaign on this screen to "Cancelled" or it is sent and
  becomes "Complete", it will no longer be visible on this screen (but visible on the My
  Campaign History screen).</p>

  <h2>Sending Campaigns</h2>

  <p>Campaigns can be started or restarted manually at any time, or started automatically
  at a future date and time if the Campaign Scheduler is enabled. Simply set the status
  to "Ready to Send" and make sure that the scheduled date is in the future.<br />
  <br />
  Manual Campaigns merge all Subscribers together and removes any opt-outs and duplicate
  e-mail addresses to ensure that only those Subscribers that want the e-mail will get
  one, and only one!<br />
  <br />
  Manual Campaigns send individual e-mail messages to each Subscriber, so that no
  snooping e-mail administrator can view the message header record and determine who else
  received the same e-mail communication. This method also produces the highest delivery
  rate.<br />
  <br />
  For HTML Campaigns, two versions of the Page are embedded into each e-mail message. One
  version is HTML, reformatted to be displayed correctly within any web-based e-mail
  client, like Gmail or Yahoo! mail. The other is a text version, created automatically
  from the Page's content, so that text-based e-mail clients don't see any messy HTML if
  they are unable to render it. Also included in the message footer is a link to the Page
  itself, so that the Subscriber can view the message from within their web browser if
  they wish.</p>

  <p>For HTML Campaigns, a snapshot copy of the Page being sent is saved within each
  Campaign, so that the content remains the same even if the Page gets changed or deleted
  after the Campaign has been created or sent.<br />
  <br />
  For HTML Campaigns, when a Campaign is created a unique tracking code will
  automatically be added to the end of each returning link (this is a link that comes
  back to your site) that does not already contain a tracking code.</p>

  <p>If the built-in Google Analytics, Who's Online, or Social Networking features are
  enabled for your site, those code snippet will not be included in Pages when they are
  e-mailed because they can cause delivery or viewing problems for some recipients.<br />
  <br />
  Because the majority of e-mail clients do not support JavaScript, E-mail Campaigns will
  not include it. This means Pages that contain Ad Regions, Photo Galleries, or any other
  type of JavaScript should not be e-mailed (i.e. don't include animationed regions like
  these in the Page Styles that you use to e-mail Pages).</p>

  <h3>Sending from your Desktop Browser</h3>

  <p>If the Campaign Scheduler is disabled, the system will use your desktop browser to
  send the Campaign. To manually start or restart a Campaign, click on the Campaign name
  and then click on "Send Campaign".<br />
  <br />
  When you click "Send Campaign", a browser window pops up and begins sending the e-mail
  messages for the Campaigns. If you close the browser window, or click "Stop &amp;
  Close" before the Campaign is complete, the Campaign will be interrupted and not all
  e-mails will be sent.<br />
  <br />
  If you do close the window or stop the Campaign, you can "resume" it again at anytime
  to sent the remaining e-mails by clicking "Send Campaign" again.<br />
  <br />
  NOTE: The system broadcasts individual e-mail messages that are not sent at one time to
  maximize delivery rate, so please be patient.</p>

  <h3>Sending using the Campaign Scheduler</h3>

  <p>If the Campaign Scheduler is enabled, and you would like the Campaign to be sent
  automatically at a future date and time, click on the Campaign name and set the "Send
  at this Date &amp; Time" field. If you leave this field blank, your Campaign will be
  sent immediately.</p>

  <h2 class="inline_header">Personalizing Campaigns</h2>

  <p>You can personalize your Campaigns so that each e-mail is delivered with the
  Recipient's name in the subject or the body of the e-mail. To do this, simply add the
  follow text tag to the body (for plain text format) or Page content (for HTML format)
  and/or the Campaign's Message Subject line:</p>

  <p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier;">^^name^^</span></p>

  <p>If you want to replace the name value with some alternative text in case the name is
  blank, then use this format:</p>

  <p class="monospace"><span style=
  "font-family: courier new,courier;">[[^^name^^||Recipient]]</span> <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&lt;- "Recipient" can be replaced with any text.</em></p>

  <p>The "name" mail merge field is replaced with the Subscriber's Contact values
  according the the following example:</p>

  <ul class="padded_list_no_bullets">
    <li class="monospace">Dear <span style=
    "font-family: courier new,courier;">^^name^^</span>,</li>

    <li>If there is a value in the Contact's Nickname field, use it:<br />
    <span class="monospace">Dear Andy,</span></li>

    <li>Else If there is a value in the Contact's Salutation, First Name, Last Name, and
    Suffix, use:<br />
    <span class="monospace">Dear Mr. Andrew Smith, Jr.,</span></li>

    <li>Else If there is a value in the Contact's Salutation, First Name, Last Name, use
    them:<br />
    <span class="monospace">Dear Mr. Andrew Smith,</span></li>

    <li>Else If there is a value in the Contact's Salutation and Last Name, use
    them:<br />
    <span class="monospace">Dear Mr. Smith,</span></li>

    <li>Else If there is a value in the Contact's First Name and Last Name, use
    them:<br />
    <span class="monospace">Dear Andrew Smith,</span></li>

    <li>Else If there is a value in the Contact's First Name and no Last Name, use
    it:<br />
    <span class="monospace">Dear Andrew,</span></li>

    <li>Else If there is no value in the Contact's First Name or Last Name, use the
    default text:<br />
    <span class="monospace">Dear Recipient,</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>For UNIX web servers (i.e. not Windows), this name value will also be used in the
  "To:" field of the e-mail, along with the e-mail address (e.g. Andrew Smith
  &lt;example@example.com&gt;). If no Contact or name info can be found, or this is a
  Windows server, then the "To:" field will only contain the e-mail address.</p>

  <h2>Deleting Campaigns</h2>

  <p>Check the box next to one of more Campaigns you wish to delete and click 'Delete
  Selected' button. Cancelling a Campaign will not delete it.</p>

  <h2>Unsolicited E-mail (SPAM)</h2>

  <p>In order to be compliant with the CAN-SPAM act, legislation intended to prevent
  unsolicited e-mail from flooding your inbox, each e-mail message sent by a Campaign
  contains an additional message at the bottom. This message provides the following
  functions, and cannot be disabled:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Allows the Subscriber to instantly "opt-out" of any future Campaigns. (They can
    opt back in later if they wish.)</li>

    <li>Adds the Physical Mailing Address of your organization from the Site
    Settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is important to point out that we do not condone unsolicited e-mail
  communications and using this system for such purpose violates our terms of use
  policies. If we detect such usage, we will disable the Campaign feature for your
  website permanently.</p>
