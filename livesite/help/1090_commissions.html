<h1>All Commissions</h1>
<p>This screen displays all orders that contained an Affiliate Code and the amount of commission due each Affiliate. You must have enabled "Affiliates" in Site Settings to see this screen. Use the date range filter to view new commissions and their totals.</p>
<p>Commissions are are added to this screen whenever an order is completed that has either an Affiliate Code in the Offer Code, or an Affiliate tracking link that was recieved when the shopper reach your website. Affiliate tracking codes will last in a shopper's browser cookie for 3 months, so even on a return visit to order, the Affiliate still gets the commission.</p>
<p>Commissions are calculated based on the Affiliate's Commission Rate, and the Commission Rate (override) from all purchased Products. Whichever percentage is lower will be used to calculate the commission for each Product ordered. So, if a Product has a commission rate of 10% and the Affiliate has a commission rate of 30%, then the commission will be 10% for that Product. If the Product is recurring, then any commissions for that Product are also recurring. (See Commissions Profiles for more information about recurring commissions). Percentages for Affiliates and Products can be changed at any time by editing the Affiliate's Contact, or the Product's override. You can also set the default commission rate for all new Affiliates in the Site Settings.</p>
<p>Commissions for online payments are not typically payable instantly. Instead, they go through a process before becoming payable to the Affiliates. We use 4 statuses to manage commissions through their lifetime. Statuses are not fixed, so you can move any commission to any status at any time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pending:</strong> When an order is successfully placed, if they shopper entered the Affiliate's Code in the Offer Code area, or they used the Affilate's tracking code link to reach your site in the last 90 days, and commissions are due, then the system will create a new "Pending" commission. If any Products are recurring, then a Commission Profile will also be created and enabled for each recurring Product by the system. (See Commissions Profiles for more information).</li>
<li><strong>Ineligible:</strong> For order gets cancelled, rejected, or otherwise do not meet the terms of your affiliate agreement, you can change the commission's status to "Ineligible", which ends the process of the commission. (Make sure you also disable any associated Commission Profile too if a recurring Product was ordered).</li>
<li><strong>Payable:</strong> Once the order or payment grace period you determine for success has transpired, and the commission is not Ineligible, you would change the commission's status to "Payable". At this point the Affiliate has earned the commission.</li>
<li><strong>Paid:</strong> Once your payment terms to Affiliates has been reached, and payment to the Affiliate has been made, you would change the status of the commission to "Paid", which would complete the commission's process.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Affiliates can track these statuses in real-time for their own commissions by viewing their My Account page.</p>
