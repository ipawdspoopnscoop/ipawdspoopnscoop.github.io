  <h1>All Offers</h1>

  <p>This screen displays any Offers.&nbsp;Offers are monetary discounts on
  Orders.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>You can add an Offer at any time.&nbsp;Make the Offer enabled, or time sensitive,
  and add triggers to indicate when they are available and when they are revealed to the
  Customers.</p>

  <p>Offers can apply to a entire Cart, each Recipient in a Cart, or to one or more
  Products in a Cart.</p>

  <p>Offers work by specifying the Offer Rules, and if the Customer's Cart meets the
  Offer Rule, then Offer Actions can be applied to the Cart by the Customer, or
  automatically by the website.</p>

  <p>All Offers can share Offer Rules and Offer Actions. An Offer can only have one Offer
  Rule, but it can have multiple Offer Actions.</p>

  <p>Each time a Customer adds or removes Products from their Cart, all Offers are
  re-evaluated and applicable Offers are applied.<br />
  <br />
  Offers can be available to a Customer based on whether an Offer Code or Key Code has
  been entered by the Customer.<br />
  <br />
  Some Offers can be made available only after the Customer has placed specific Products
  in their Cart, or when their Order subtotal reaches a predefined amount.<br />
  <br />
  Some Offers require the Customer to enter an Offer Code or Key Code during the checkout
  process, while other Orders do not.<br />
  <br />
  Some Offers will require interactivity with the Customer. This happens automatically.
  So if the Offer's action is to add a shippable Product to the Cart, and there are
  multiple recipients in the Cart,&nbsp;then the Customer will be prompted to select the
  recipient that will receive the shippable Product.<br />
  <br />
  NOTE: Free shippable Products Offers must be applied to a recipient with an Order
  subtotal greater than "0.00". All Offers that add a free shippable Product to a Cart
  will also surpress any shipping charges associated with the Product, regardless of the
  Shipping Method selected.<br />
  <br />
  Offers are calculated and displayed on the Shopping Cart Page and the Express Order
  Page. &nbsp;This is also where the Customer will enter an Offer Code, if
  necessary.<br />
  <br />
  Some Offers do not require a Customer to enter a Code during the checkout process. We
  call these "automatic" Offers. These Offers are applied automatically to any Cart that
  satisfies an enabled Offer's Rule. An example of an automatic Offer would be a quantity
  discount for one or more Products. More than one automatic Offer can be applied to an
  Order.<br />
  <br />
  Some Offers require that the Customer enter an Offer Code or Key Code during the
  checkout process to make the Offer available to them.&nbsp;We call these "manual"
  Offers. &nbsp;Only one manual Offer code can be applied to an Order at a time.
  &nbsp;Only the Offers tied to one Offer Code may be applied to a Cart at any one time.
  &nbsp;If a Customer enters a Offer Code after already entering a different Offer Code,
  only the the Offer associated with the most recent Offer Code entered will be applied
  to the Cart.<br />
  <br />
  You can group Offers together by giving them the same code. If the group of Offers all
  have "Only Apply Best Offer" checked, then the system will only apply the best Offer
  from the group. Alternatively, if "Only Apply Best Offer" is not checked then all of
  the Offers will be applied. The former allows you to setup offers where only one offer
  will be given based on order levels (e.g. increasingly better free product at higher
  order levels). The latter allows multiple Offers to be applied when a customer enters a
  single Offer code. It is important that all Offers in a group have the same setting for
  "Only Apply Best Offer".</p>

  <h2>Up-selling Offers</h2>

  <p>Some Offers are published on your website or in your direct mail campaigns, but
  there may also be a need to provide unpublished, point of purchase incentives once the
  Customer begins to checkout on your website. This process is called
  "up-selling".<br />
  <br />
  To better understand up-selling, here is an example: When you visit your local grocery
  store, add all of the items into your shopping basket that you came for, you make your
  way to the checkout line. This area of the store is usually lined with in-store
  promotions designed to entice you into buying more from them at the point of purchase.
   This is a proven and effective method of increasing the average order amount,
  which is important to the success of the store.<br />
  <br />
  In the system, you can create very intelligent up-selling triggers using Offers,
  allowing your website to do the up-selling for you, based on what Products each
  Customer has already placed in their Cart, or by the Cart's current subtotal amount,
  so:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When the Cart subtotal reaches a specific monetary amount, offer the Customer a
    deeper discount if they order more. When the Cart subtotal reaches an even higher
    specific monetary amount, offer the Customer an even deeper discount if they order
    more, and so on.</li>

    <li>When the quantity of a Product is close to a certain level,&nbsp;offer the
    Customer a deeper discount to if the Customer increases the quantity. When the
    quantity of a Product reaches an even higher number, offer the Customer an even
    deeper discount if the Customer increases the quantity, and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To create an Offer, click on "Create Offer".</p>

  <p>TIP: Because Offers are linked to existing Offer Rules and Offer Actions, create
  your Offer Rules first, then your Offer Actions, then your Offers.</p>
