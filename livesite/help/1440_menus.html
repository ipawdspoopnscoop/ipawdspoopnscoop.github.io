<h1>All Menus</h1>

<p> Site Designers can create and place interactive Menus into Page Styles.</p>

<p>By using Menus, your Site Managers (and selected Content Managers) will be able to maintain the
website navigation systems themselves, just like Page content, without
the need to edit any of the underlying programming that make the Menus
work.</p>

<p>You can create as many Menus as you wish, so you can use Menus to
create site-wide Menus, portal area Menus, and even dynamic site maps.</p>

<h2>Searching Menus</h2>

<p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for
any Menu by it's properties.</p>

<h2>Creating Menus</h2>

<p>Click "Create Menu" to create a Menu.  You can add an effect to a menu in order to enable
pop-up or accordion features without including complex JavaScript libraries.  The effect
will add sleek animation to the user interface for multi-level menus.</p>

<p>Once you have created the Menu, add a &lt;menu&gt; tag to one, some, or
all of your Pages Styles to specify the location and scope of your Menu
across your website's Pages. &nbsp;At that point, your Site Managers and some Content Managers
will be able to edit the Menu and add items to it right from the Edit
Page screen.</p>

<h2>Editing Menus</h2>

<p>Site Managers (and selected Content Managers) can simply click on "Edit" on the Menu when editing a
Page in order to add/remove Menu items and link them
to Pages or other websites. &nbsp;Menus are "safe" because Content Managers and Site
Managers cannot modify or delete the underlying Menu Region and its Properties, which could cause a problem when rendering a Page.</p>
