        Date. This is an optional value, added to the Arrival Date calculation only if
        the Adjust Transit Days is set in the Shipping Method selected by the Customer.
        This value is ignored if Shipping Cut-offs are configured for an Arrival Date.
        Shipping Cut-offs override Preparation Time for Products, transit values for
        Shipping Methods, and Transit Adjustment Days for Countries.</td>
