  <h1>Import Users</h1>

  <p>You can Import Users into your website database from your local computer any Comma
  Separated Values (CSV) File. CSV file format is a universally accepted way to move data
  between systems. Most spreadsheet programs and databases can save data as a CSV text
  file so it is an ideal way to upload Users.</p>

  <h2>Import from CSV file or Microsoft Excel</h2>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />
  1. Prepare your data</span><br />
  <br />
  The easiest way is to get your data into columns in a spreadsheet. You may import Users
  by uploading a CSV file. You can save a CSV file from Microsoft Excel. Here are the
  guidelines for the CSV file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The first row of the CSV file must contain the names of the columns that you wish
    to import data for.</li>

    <li>Columns can be listed in any order.</li>

    <li>If you are saving a CSV file on a Mac, you might need to select the "Windows CSV"
    format in Excel.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is the list of the valid User Properties that you can import. Place one of the
  following on the first row of each of your data columns:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>username</li>

    <li>email_address</li>
  </ul>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />

        you want the access to be granted indefinitely. The expiration date should be the
        last day that you want the User to still be able to access the content. After the
        expiration date, access will be automatically removed and the date will appear in
        red. If the User attempts to access the content after the expiration date, then
        he/she will receive an error that explains that his/her access has expired.<br />

        TIP: Use this feature to allow access to select Users, for example, to allow only
        your employees to access a staff-only portal area of your website. &nbsp;Simply
        create a Private Folder for each group, and assign access to certain Users.<br />
        <br />
        TIP: These Folders can also be set when a Customer orders a Product that has it's
        "Grant Private Access to Customer" feature set.</td>
