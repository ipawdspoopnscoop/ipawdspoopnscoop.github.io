  Clicking "Upload" to send the file from your local computer up to the web server.
  Please be patient, large files may take a few minutes.<br />
  <br />
  NOTE: There is no maximum file size that can be uploaded, however, success will depend
  on your own Internet connection speed at the time of the upload, and any file size
  limitation that your hosting provider sets on your hosting account. If you receive an
  error, we recommend trying the upload at a less busy time of day or trying the upload
  with a smaller file.</p>
