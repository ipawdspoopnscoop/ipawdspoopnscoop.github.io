                        <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
                        <p>Ipawd's Poop 'N Scoop LLC was founded and started by Donna Holmes and Shyann Haderlie in June of 2011.  Both Donna and Shyann are huge animal lovers.  We have three dogs, two cats, and three birds currently.  When we were trying to come up with a name for the business we thought why not name it after a pet after all we are starting a pet related business.  So we decided to name our business after our cat who was an orange tabby that wore a red collar and his name was Ipawd.  Ipawd was hit by a car in May of 2011 and we miss him dearly.  The name and colors all come from him and remind us of him.  Here is a picture of him in the backyard.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>We started this business because we want to help provide our community with a healthier and safer environment and one of the key ways to do that is to raise awareness about the dangers of pet waste.  Our goals include raising awareness of these hazards as well as providing a solution to these hazards.  We genuinly want to help you, your family, including the four legged ones, have happier and healthier lives by reducing the hazards that come along with those all so lovable pets that we all want.  </p>
